  "description": "A flaw was found in tpm2-tools in versions before 5.1.1 and before 4.3.2. tpm2_import used a fixed AES key for the inner wrapper, potentially allowing a MITM attacker to unwrap the inner portion and reveal the key being imported. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",
