  "description": "On Linux, if the secure computing mode BPF (seccomp-bpf) filter is running when the Gecko Media Plugin sandbox is started, the sandbox fails to be applied and items that would run within the sandbox are run protected only by the running filter which is typically weak compared to the sandbox. Note: this issue only affects Linux. Other operating systems are not affected. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 52 and Thunderbird \u003c 52.",
