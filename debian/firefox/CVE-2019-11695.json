  "description": "A custom cursor defined by scripting on a site can position itself over the addressbar to spoof the actual cursor when it should not be allowed outside of the primary web content area. This could be used by a malicious site to trick users into clicking on permission prompts, doorhanger notifications, or other buttons inadvertently if the location is spoofed over the user interface. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 67.",
