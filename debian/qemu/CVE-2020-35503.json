  "description": "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the megasas-gen2 SCSI host bus adapter emulation of QEMU in versions before and including 6.0. This issue occurs in the megasas_command_cancelled() callback function while dropping a SCSI request. This flaw allows a privileged guest user to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.",
