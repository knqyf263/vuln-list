  "description": "Memory safety bugs were reported in Firefox 49 and Firefox ESR 45.4. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort that some of these could be exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Thunderbird \u003c 45.5, Firefox ESR \u003c 45.5, and Firefox \u003c 50.",
