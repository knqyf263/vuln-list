  "description": "curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.",
