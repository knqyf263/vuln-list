  "description": "Use-after-free vulnerability in the nfqnl_zcopy function in net/netfilter/nfnetlink_queue_core.c in the Linux kernel through 3.13.6 allows attackers to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory by leveraging the absence of a certain orphaning operation. NOTE: the affected code was moved to the skb_zerocopy function in net/core/skbuff.c before the vulnerability was announced.",
