  "description": "A flaw was found in the Nosy driver in the Linux kernel. This issue allows a device to be inserted twice into a doubly-linked list, leading to a use-after-free when one of these devices is removed. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability. Versions before kernel 5.12-rc6 are affected",
