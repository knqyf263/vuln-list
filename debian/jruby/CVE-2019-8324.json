  "description": "An issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.6 and later through 3.0.2. A crafted gem with a multi-line name is not handled correctly. Therefore, an attacker could inject arbitrary code to the stub line of gemspec, which is eval-ed by code in ensure_loadable_spec during the preinstall check.",
