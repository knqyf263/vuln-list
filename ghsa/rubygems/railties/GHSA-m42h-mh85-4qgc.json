    "Description": "# Possible Remote Code Execution Exploit in Rails Development Mode\n\nImpact \n------ \nWith some knowledge of a target application it is possible for an attacker to \nguess the automatically generated development mode secret token.  This secret \ntoken can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a \nremote code execution exploit. \n\nAll users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the \nworkarounds immediately. \n\nReleases \n-------- \nThe 6.0.0.beta3 and 5.2.2.1 releases are available at the normal locations. \n\nWorkarounds \n----------- \nThis issue can be mitigated by specifying a secret key in development mode. \nIn \"config/environments/development.rb\" add this: \n\n```\n  config.secret_key_base = SecureRandom.hex(64) \n```\n\nPlease note that only the 5.2.x, 5.1.x, 5.0.x, and 4.2.x series are supported \nat present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as \nsoon as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security \nfixes for unsupported releases. \n\nCredits \n------- \nThanks to ooooooo_q \n",
