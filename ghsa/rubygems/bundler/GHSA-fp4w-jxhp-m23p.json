    "Description": "Bundler 1.16.0 through 2.2.9 and 2.2.11 through 2.2.17 sometimes chooses a dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended choice was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that is explicitly depended on by the application.",
