    "Description": "The `activerecord-session_store` (aka Active Record Session Store) component through 1.1.3 for Ruby on Rails does not use a constant-time approach when delivering information about whether a guessed session ID is valid. Consequently, remote attackers can leverage timing discrepancies to achieve a correct guess in a relatively short amount of time. This is a related issue to CVE-2019-16782. \n\n## Recommendation\n\nAs of the publishing of this advisory there is no official fix in place. An unnoficial fix is described in [this comment](https://github.com/rails/activerecord-session_store/pull/151#issuecomment-631705247).",
