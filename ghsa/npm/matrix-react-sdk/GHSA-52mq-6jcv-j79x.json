    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents. The content is opened with a `blob` origin that cannot access Matrix user data, so messages and secrets are not at risk.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5657, which is included in 3.15.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.",
