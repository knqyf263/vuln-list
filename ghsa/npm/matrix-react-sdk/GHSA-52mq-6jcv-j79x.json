    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe user content sandbox can be abused to trick users into opening unexpected documents after several user interactions. The content can be opened with a `blob` origin from the Matrix client, so it is possible for a malicious document to access user messages and secrets.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed by https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-react-sdk/pull/5657, which is included in 3.15.0.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds.",
