    "Description": "### Impact\nPassing HTML containing `\u003coption\u003e` elements from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing them - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`, `.append()`, and others) may execute untrusted code.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo workaround this issue without upgrading, use [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) with its `SAFE_FOR_JQUERY` option to sanitize the HTML string before passing it to a jQuery method.\n\n### References\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues). If you don't find an answer, open a new issue.",
