    "Description": "### Impact\nPassing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`, `.append()`, and others) may execute untrusted code.\n\n### Patches\nThis problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.\n\n### Workarounds\nTo workaround the issue without upgrading, adding the following to your code:\n\n```js\njQuery.htmlPrefilter = function( html ) {\n\treturn html;\n};\n```\n\nYou need to use at least jQuery 1.12/2.2 or newer to be able to apply this workaround.\n\n### References\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\nhttps://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, search for a relevant issue in [the jQuery repo](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues). If you don't find an answer, open a new issue.",
