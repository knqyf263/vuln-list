    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen certain sequences of `update()` calls with large values (multiple GBs) for symetric encryption or decryption occur, it's possible for an integer overflow to happen, leading to mishandling of buffers. \n\n### Patches\nThis is patched in version 3.3.2 and newer.\n\n### References\n- https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/issues/5615",
