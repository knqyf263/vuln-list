    "Description": "### Impact\n\nUsers who are using an HTTPS proxy to issue HTTPS requests and haven't configured their own SSLContext via `proxy_config`.\nOnly the default SSLContext is impacted.\n\n### Patches\n\n[urllib3 \u003e=1.26.4 has the issue resolved](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/releases/tag/1.26.4). urllib3\u003c1.26 is not impacted due to not supporting HTTPS requests via HTTPS proxies.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nUpgrading is recommended as this is a minor release and not likely to break current usage.\n\nConfiguring an `SSLContext` with `check_hostname=True` and passing via `proxy_config` instead of relying on the default `SSLContext`\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Email us at [sethmichaellarson@gmail.com](mailto:sethmichaellarson@gmail.com)",
