    "Description": "### Impact\nA websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame.\n\n### Patches\nVersion 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits.\n\n### Workarounds\nRestricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion. No workaround to protect Eventlet process.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [eventlet](https://github.com/eventlet/eventlet/issues)\n* Contact current maintainers.
