    "Description": "### Impact\n_What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?_\n\nOpen redirect vulnerability — a maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-server could redirect the browser to a different website.\n\nIt is caused by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` middleware.\n\n### Patches\n_Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?_\n\nThis security problem has been fixed in v3.7.4. Upgrade your dependency as follows:\n[`pip install aiohttp \u003e= 3.7.4`]\n\n### Workarounds\n_Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?_\n\nIf upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be to avoid using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your applications.\n\n### References\n_Are there any links users can visit to find out more?_\n\n* [aiohttp @ PyPI]\n* [GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg]\n* [OWASP page on open redirects]\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in the [aiohttp repo](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/new/choose)\n* Email us at wk+aio-libs-security@sydorenko.org.ua and/or andrew.svetlov+aio-libs-security@gmail.com\n\nCredit: [Jelmer Vernooĳ] and [Beast Glatisant].\n\n[aiohttp @ PyPI]: https://pypi.org/p/aiohttp\n[`pip install aiohttp \u003e= 3.7.4`]: https://pypi.org/project/aiohttp/3.7.4/\n[GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg]: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/security/advisories/GHSA-v6wp-4m6f-gcjg\n[OWASP page on open redirects]:\nhttps://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards_Cheat_Sheet.html\n\n[Jelmer Vernooĳ]: https://jelmer.uk\n[Beast Glatisant]: https://github.com/g147",
