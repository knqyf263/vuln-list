    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAutomatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. \n\n### Patches\n\nVersion 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. \n\nIn addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. \n\n### Workarounds\n\nUsers may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.  \n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [the django-filter repo](https://github.com/carltongibson/django-filter)\n\nThanks to Marcin Waraksa for the report.
