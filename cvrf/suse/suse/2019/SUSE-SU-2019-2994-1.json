(bsc#1135584)\n- Rewrote rolling updates and replaced running stage.0 with manual commands to prevent infinite loop. (bsc#1134444)\n- Improved name of CaaSP to its fuller version. (bsc#1151439)\n- Verify which OSD's are going to be removed before running stage.5. (bsc#1150406)\n- Added two additional steps to recovering an OSD. (bsc#1147132)\n\nFixes in ceph-iscsi:\n\n- Validate kernel LIO controls type and value (bsc#1140491)\n- TPG lun_id persistence (bsc#1145618)\n- Target level CHAP authentication (bsc#1145617)\n\nceph-iscsi was updated to the upstream 3.2 release:\n\n- Always use host FQDN instead of shortname\n- Validate min/max value for target controls and rbd:user/tcmu-runner image\n  controls (bsc#1140491)\n\n",
