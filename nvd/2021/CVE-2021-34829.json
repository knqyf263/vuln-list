Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the handling of the HNAP_AUTH HTTP header. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the device. Was ZDI-CAN-12065."
