          "value": "OpenProject is open-source, web-based project management software. In versions prior to 11.3.3, the `MessagesController` class of OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip `\u003cpre\u003e` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\\s)` part can match a space character in two ways, so an unterminated `\u003cpre\u003e` tag containing `n` spaces causes Ruby's regex engine to backtrack to try 2\u003csup\u003en\u003c/sup\u003e states in the NFA. This will result in a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The issue is fixed in OpenProject 11.3.3. As a workaround, one may install the patch manually."
