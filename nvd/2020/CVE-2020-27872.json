Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the mini_httpd service, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from improper state tracking in the password recovery process. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute code in the context of root.
