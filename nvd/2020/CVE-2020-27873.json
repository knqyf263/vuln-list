Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the SOAP API endpoint, which listens on TCP port 80 by default. The issue results from the lack of proper access control. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise. Was ZDI-CAN-11559."
