  "statement": "Red Hat is aware of this issue and is tracking it via the following bug:\nhttps://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2010-0789\nThis issue affects Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 because it ships fusermount suid root, however the impact of this flaw is minimized due to the fact that only members in group fuse may use it the executable is owned root:fuse and mode 4750.\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 3 and 4 do not provide the fuse package.\nThe Red Hat Security Response Team has rated this issue as having low security impact, a future update may address this flaw.
