  "mitigation": "As the midi module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install snd-rawmidi /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-snd-rawmidi.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the snd-rawmidi modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the CIFS kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any midi / sound devices are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires this module to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",
