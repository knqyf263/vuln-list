  "details": [
    "Bluetooth LE and BR/EDR secure pairing in Bluetooth Core Specification 2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session. The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time.",
    "A vulnerability was found in the bluez, where Passkey Entry protocol used in Secure Simple Pairing (SSP), Secure Connections (SC) and LE Secure Connections (LESC) of the Bluetooth Core Specification is vulnerable to an impersonation attack where an active attacker can impersonate the initiating device without any previous knowledge."
