    "Engine.IO before 4.0.0 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (resource consumption) via a POST request to the long polling transport.",
    "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was found in engine.io. If an attacker crafts a packet with a very large payload length or crafts many small packets, this can cause the engine.io to consume an ever increasing amount of memory and/or CPU, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
