  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection vulnerability is present in versions before 3.9.0, 5.2.0, and 6.3.0. If user-supplied input was passed into append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a newline could be injected leading to limited header injection. Upon seeing a newline in the header, rails will silently create a new Content-Security-Policy header with the remaining value of the original string. It will continue to create new headers for each newline. This has been fixed in 6.3.0, 5.2.0, and 3.9.0.",
    "A directive injection vulnerability was found in Secure Headers RubyGem before versions 3.9.0, 5.2.0, and 6.3.0. If user-supplied input was passed into the vulnerable function, a new line could be injected, leading to limited header injection, which could create a new Content Security Policy header in the HTTP response."
