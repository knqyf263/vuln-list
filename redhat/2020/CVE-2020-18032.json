    "Buffer Overflow in Graphviz Graph Visualization Tools from commit ID f8b9e035 and earlier allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (application crash) by loading a crafted file into the \"lib/common/shapes.c\" component.",
    "A flaw was found in graphviz. A wrong assumption in record_init function leads to an off-by-one write in parse_reclbl function, allowing an attacker who can provide graph input to potentially execute code when the label of a node is invalid and shorter than two characters. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
