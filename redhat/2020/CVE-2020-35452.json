    "Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.46 A specially crafted Digest nonce can cause a stack overflow in mod_auth_digest. There is no report of this overflow being exploitable, nor the Apache HTTP Server team could create one, though some particular compiler and/or compilation option might make it possible, with limited consequences anyway due to the size (a single byte) and the value (zero byte) of the overflow",
    "A flaw was found in Apache httpd. The mod_auth_digest has a single zero byte stack overflow. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
