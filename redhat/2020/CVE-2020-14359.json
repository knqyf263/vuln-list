  "details": [
    "A vulnerability was found in all versions of keycloak, where on using lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) we can bypass our Gatekeeper. Lower case headers are also accepted by some webservers (e.g. Jetty). This means there is no protection when we put a Gatekeeper in front of a Jetty server and use lowercase headers.",
    "A flaw was found in keycloak. Lower case HTTP headers (via cURL) can bypass Gatekeeper and will still be accepted by some webservers, leaving the Jetty server without protection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
