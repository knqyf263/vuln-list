We may update the Ruby on Rails and rails-core dependency in a future release.\nin OpenShift Container Platform 3.11, rubygem-activesupport is shipped, and it's included in the logging-fluentd container for use by rubygem-kubeclient [1]. The kubeclient gem does NOT make use of the vulnerable class, its only included for the inflector part of activesupport.",

  "details": [
    "A deserialization of untrusted data vulnernerability exists in rails \u003c 5.2.4.3, rails \u003c 6.0.3.1 that can allow an attacker to unmarshal user-provided objects in MemCacheStore and RedisCacheStore potentially resulting in an RCE.",
    "A flaw was found in rubygem-activesupport. An untrusted user input can be written to the cache store using the `raw: true` parameter which can lead to the result being evaluated as a marshaled object instead of plain text. The threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
