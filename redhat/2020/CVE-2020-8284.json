  "mitigation": "This flaw can be mitigated in curl as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections when using curl by passing the `--ftp-skip-pasv-ip` command line option to curl. For usage of libcurl, set `CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP` to `1L`[1]. Note that these mitigations could cause problems in the uncommon instance that the server needs the client to connect back to an IP other than the control connection IP address.\n1. https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_FTP_SKIP_PASV_IP.html",

If curl operates on a URL provided by a user (which by all means is an unwise setup), a user can exploit that and pass in a URL to a malicious FTP server instance without needing any server breach to perform the attack."
