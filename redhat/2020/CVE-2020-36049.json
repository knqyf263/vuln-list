    "socket.io-parser before 3.4.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a large packet because a concatenation approach is used.",
    "An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability was found in socket.io-parser. If an attacker crafts a packet with a very large payload length, this can cause the parser to consume an ever-increasing amount of memory, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
