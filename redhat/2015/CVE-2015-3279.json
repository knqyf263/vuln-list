    "Integer overflow in filter/texttopdf.c in texttopdf in cups-filters before 1.0.71 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted line size in a print job, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "An integer overflow flaw, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow, was discovered in the way the texttopdf utility of cups-filter processed print jobs with a specially crafted line size. An attacker able to submit print jobs could use this flaw to crash texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the \"lp\" user."
