  "details": [
    "The sctp_init function in net/sctp/protocol.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.3 has an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (panic or memory corruption) by creating SCTP sockets before all of the steps have finished.",
    "A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the SCTP implementation. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service on the system by triggering a kernel panic when creating multiple sockets in parallel while the system did not have the SCTP module loaded."
