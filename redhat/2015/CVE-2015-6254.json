    "The (1) Service Provider (SP) and (2) Identity Provider (IdP) in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure that the Destination attribute in a Response element in a SAML assertion matches the location from which the message was received, which allows remote attackers to have unspecified impact via unknown vectors.  NOTE: this identifier was SPLIT from CVE-2015-0277 per ADT2 due to different vulnerability types.",
    "A flaw was found in the way PicketLink's Service Provider (SP) and Identity Provider (IdP) handled certain requests. The SP and IdP in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure that the Destination attribute in a Response element in the SAML assertion matches the location from which the message was received. This flaw allows a remote attacker to log into a victim's account via PicketLink."
