  "details": [
    "Race condition in OpenStack Neutron before 2014.2.4 and 2015.1 before 2015.1.2, when using the ML2 plugin or the security groups AMQP API, allows remote authenticated users to bypass IP anti-spoofing controls by changing the device owner of a port to start with network: before the security group rules are applied.",
    "A race-condition flaw leading to ACL bypass was discovered in OpenStack Networking (neutron). An authenticated user could change the owner of a port after it was created but before firewall rules were applied, thus preventing firewall control checks from occurring. All OpenStack Networking deployments that used either the ML2 plug-in or a plug-in that relied on the security groups AMQP API were affected."
