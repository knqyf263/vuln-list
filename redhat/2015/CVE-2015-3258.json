    "Heap-based buffer overflow in the WriteProlog function in filter/texttopdf.c in texttopdf in cups-filters before 1.0.70 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a small line size in a print job.",
    "A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the way the texttopdf utility of cups-filter processed print jobs with a specially crafted line size. An attacker able to submit print jobs could use this flaw to crash texttopdf or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the \"lp\" user."
