  "details": [
    "The HWP filter in LibreOffice before 4.3.7 and 4.4.x before 4.4.2 and Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted HWP document, which triggers an out-of-bounds write.",
    "A flaw was found in the way the LibreOffice HWP (Hangul Word Processor) file filter processed certain HWP documents. An attacker able to trick a user into opening a specially crafted HWP document could possibly use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening that document."
