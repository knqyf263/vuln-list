    "Foreman before 1.8.1 does not set the secure flag for the _session_id cookie in an https session, which makes it easier for remote attackers to capture this cookie by intercepting its transmission within an http session.",
    "It was found that Foreman did not set the HttpOnly flag on session cookies. This could allow a malicious script to access the session cookie."
