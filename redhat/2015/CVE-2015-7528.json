    "Kubernetes before 1.2.0-alpha.5 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary pod logs via a container name.",
    "It was found that OpenShift's API back end did not verify requests for pod log locations, allowing a pod on a Node to request logs for any other pod on that Node. A remote attacker could use this flaw to view sensitive information via pod logs that they would normally not have access to."
