  "details": [
    "The Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.2.0 through 6.3.2 does not properly verify authorization conditions, which allows remote authenticated users to add, modify, and undefine otherwise restricted attributes by leveraging the Maintainer role.",
    "It was discovered that the Role Based Access Control (RBAC) implementation did not sufficiently verify all authorization conditions that are required by the Maintainer role to perform certain administrative actions. An authenticated user with the Maintainer role could use this flaw to add, modify, or undefine a limited set of attributes and their values, which otherwise cannot be written to."
