    "The EJB invocation handler implementation in Red Hat JBossWS, as used in JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP) 6.2.0 and 6.3.0, does not properly enforce the method level restrictions for outbound messages, which allows remote authenticated users to access otherwise restricted JAX-WS handlers by leveraging permissions to the EJB class. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2013-2133.",
    "It was found that the fix for CVE-2013-2133 was incomplete: the JAX-WS handlers were being executed for outbound messages even when authorization had failed. A remote attacker who is authorized to access the EJB class, could invoke a JAX-WS handler which they were not authorized to invoke."
