  "details": [
    "pulp.spec in the installation process for Pulp 2.8.3 generates the RSA key pairs used to validate messages between the pulp server and pulp consumers in a directory that is world-readable before later modifying the permissions, which might allow local users to read the generated RSA keys via reading the key files while the installation process is running.",
    "It was found that the private RSA key was created in a directory that is world-readable for a small amount of time. A local user could possibly use this flaw to gain access to the private key information in the file."
