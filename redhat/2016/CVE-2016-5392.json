    "The API server in Kubernetes, as used in Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, in a multi tenant environment allows remote authenticated users with knowledge of other project names to obtain sensitive project and user information via vectors related to the watch-cache list.",
    "The Kubernetes API server contains a watch cache that speeds up performance. Due to an input validation error OpenShift Enterprise may return data for other users and projects when queried by a user. An attacker with knowledge of other project names could use this vulnerability to view their information."
