    "client/consumer/cli.py in Pulp before 2.8.3 writes consumer private keys to etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert.pem as world-readable, which allows remote authenticated users to obtain the consumer private keys and escalate privileges by reading /etc/pki/pulp/consumer/consumer-cert, and authenticating as a consumer user.",
    "It was found that the private key for the agent certificate was contained in a world-readable file. A local user could possibly use this flaw to gain access to the private key information in the file."
