  "statement": "This issue affects the versions of python-twisted as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6.x. However due to the manner in which python-twisted is used exploitation of this issue by an attacker would require significant access to the server, or be able to modify requests from other users via additional vulnerabilities. A future update may address this issue.",

  "name": "CVE-2016-1000111",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Twisted before 16.3.1 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18 namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect CGI applications from the presence of untrusted client data in the HTTP_PROXY environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect a CGI application's outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.",
    "It was discovered that python-twisted-web used the value of the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the HTTP_PROXY environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request."
