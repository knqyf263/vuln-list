    "Openshift allows remote attackers to gain privileges by updating a build configuration that was created with an allowed type to a type that is not allowed.",
    "An authorization flaw was discovered in Kubernetes; the API server did not properly check user permissions when handling certain build-configuration strategies. A remote attacker could create build configurations with strategies that violate policy. Although the attacker could not launch the build themselves (launch fails when the policy is violated), if the build configuration files were later launched by other privileged services (such as automated triggers), user privileges could be bypassed allowing attacker escalation."
