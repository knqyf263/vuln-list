  "details": [
    "curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows a malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly \"short-cut\" the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to ignore the server certificate check.",
    "A flaw was found in the way libcurl handled TLS 1.3 session tickets. A malicious HTTPS proxy could possibly use this flaw to make libcurl resume a TLS session it previously had with the proxy while intending to resume a TLS session with a target server, making it possible for the proxy to perform a man-in-the-middle attack."
