  "mitigation": "To mitigate this flaw Cache Manager access privileges can be hardened, for example by requiring authentication or other access controls in the \"http_access\" directive beyond the default IP address restriction. Alternatively, Cache Manager access can be disabled entirely if not needed. To do so, place the following line in `squid.conf` before lines containing \"allow\" :\n```\nhttp_access deny manager\n```",
