    "A flaw was found in openstack-neutron where, when using OpenvSwitch, the ICMPv6 packet origin was not verified. When this occurs, a machine in the same layer of two networks can forge requests. This flaw allows a remote attacker to spoof the address origin and misdirect traffic. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system confidentiality and system availability."
