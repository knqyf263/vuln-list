  "details": [
    "An authorization bypass vulnerability was found in envoyproxy/envoy. An attacker can potentially craft an HTTP request that defines a certain pattern of escaped characters in the URI path (such as %2F, %2f, %5C or %5c), allowing them to bypass the envoy authorization service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
