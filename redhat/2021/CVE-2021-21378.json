    "An authentication bypass vulnerability was found in envoyproxy/envoy. When specifying a JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication filter, if `allow_missing` is also used, this flaw allows an attacker to craft a request with a JWT token with an incorrect issuer bypassing the filter. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality and integrity."
