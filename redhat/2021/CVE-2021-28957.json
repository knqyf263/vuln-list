  "name": "CVE-2021-28957",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "An XSS vulnerability was discovered in python-lxml's clean module versions before 4.6.3. When disabling the safe_attrs_only and forms arguments, the Cleaner class does not remove the formaction attribute allowing for JS to bypass the sanitizer. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to run arbitrary JS code on users who interact with incorrectly sanitized HTML. This issue is patched in lxml 4.6.3.",
    "A flaw was found in python-lxml. The HTML5 formaction attribute is not input sanitized like the HTML action attribute is which can lead to a Cross-Site Scripting attack (XSS) when an application uses python-lxml to sanitize user inputs. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
