  "details": [
    "It was found in OpenShift Container Platform 4 that the Machine Config Server (MCS) endpoint, which runs on Master Nodes on ports 22623 and 22624 is accessible without authentication. The MCS endpoint provides ignition configuration used for bootstrapping Nodes and can include some sensitive data, e.g. registry pull secrets.\nWhen running clusters with OpenShift supported network types, applications in the cluster are blocked from sending traffic to MCS ports via iptables rules injected into pods. This ensures that no unprivileged workloads are able to access the MCS. As the security measure is implemented within the code for the network plugins, clusters that uses other network plugins do not have this protection method in place. Pods run with hostNetwork access can also access the MCS."
