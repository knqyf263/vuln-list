  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in OpenShift's machine-config-operator. When running with Red Hat supported network types, applications in the cluster are blocked from sending traffic to ports 22623 or 22624 via iptables rules injected into the pod. This ensures that no unprivileged workloads are able to access the Machine Config Server (MCS) and download ignition configuration, which may contain sensitive information. Unfortunately, this security measure is implemented within the code for the network plugins, so a cluster that uses another network plugin does not have this protection mechanism in place. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
