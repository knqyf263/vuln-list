  "statement": "The exploitation of this flaw requires RPM's package verification level to be set to \"digest\" or \"none\". In addition, to exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM.  It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs from trusted repositories.",

    "A flaw was found in libdnf's signature verification functionality. This flaw allows an attacker to achieve code execution if they can alter the header information of an RPM package and then trick a user or system into installing it. The highest risk of this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability."
