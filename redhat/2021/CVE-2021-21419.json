  "details": [
    "Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0 restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround, restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet process.",
    "A flaw was found in eventlet. If an unauthenticated user manages to send large websocket frames or highly compressed data frames that can lead to memory exhaustion. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (DoS)."
