  "statement": "This issue did not affect the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 as they did not use strdupa to duplicate strings in unit_name_path_escape function, but strdup, which allocates space on the heap.\nFurther, any Red Hat product which is supported on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform is also potentially impacted. This includes:\n* Product containers which are based on the RHEL or UBI container images.  These images are updated regularly, and container health indicating whether a fix to this flaw is available can be seen in the Container Health Index, part of the Red Hat Container Catalog (https://access.redhat.com/containers).  In addition, any customer containers should be manually rebuilt when the base images are updated.\n* Products which pull packages from the RHEL channel.  Please ensure that the underlying Red Hat Enterprise Linux systemd package is current in these product environments.",

  "name": "CVE-2021-33910",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in systemd. The use of alloca function with an uncontrolled size in function unit_name_path_escape allows a local attacker, able to mount a filesystem on a very long path, to crash systemd and the whole system by allocating a very large space in the stack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to the system availability."
