  "mitigation": "The default Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel prevents unprivileged users from being able to use eBPF by the kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled sysctl.   This would require a privileged user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN or root to be able to abuse this flaw reducing its attack space.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the eBPF for unprivileged users is always disabled.\nFor the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 to confirm the current state, inspect the sysctl with the command:\n# cat /proc/sys/kernel/unprivileged_bpf_disabled\nThe setting of 1 would mean that unprivileged users can not use eBPF, mitigating the flaw.\nA kernel update will be required to mitigate the flaw for the root or users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capabilities.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernels eBPF verification code. It was discovered that eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) did not update the 32-bit bounds.  By default accessing the eBPF verifier is only accessible to privileged users with CAP_SYS_ADMIN. A local user with the ability to insert eBPF instructions could use this flaw to crash the system or possibly escalate their privileges on the system."
