  "mitigation": "The LIBISCSI module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install libiscsi /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-libiscsi.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the libiscsi modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the libiscsi kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any network interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires iscsi to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",
