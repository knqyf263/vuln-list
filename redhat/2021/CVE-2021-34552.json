    "Pillow through 8.2.0 and PIL (aka Python Imaging Library) through 1.1.7 allow an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into a convert function to trigger a buffer overflow in Convert.c.",
    "A flaw was found in python-pillow. This flaw allows an attacker to pass controlled parameters directly into a convert function, triggering a buffer overflow in the Convert.c. function. The highest threat to this vulnerability is to system availability.\nIn Red Hat Quay, a vulnerable version of python-pillow is shipped with quay-registry-container, however the invoice generation feature which uses python-pillow is disabled by default. Therefore impact has been rated Moderate."
