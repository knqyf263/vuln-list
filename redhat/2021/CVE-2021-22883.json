  "details": [
    "Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory.",
    "A flaw was foun in nodejs. When too many connection attempts with an 'unknownProtocol' are established a leak of file descriptors can occur leading to a potential denial of service. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system, then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the process also from opening. If no file descriptor limit is configured, then this can lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the system to run out of memory. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
