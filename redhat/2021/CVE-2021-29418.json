  "statement": "The impact of this flaw largely depends on the environment where the affected library is being used. This flaw could be used to redirect an adversary to an exposed, unprotected endpoint. Depending on the functionality of the affected endpoint that could result in a loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability. The affected library is used in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes only in the development and build processes. Consequently the severity of this flaw to RHACM is downgraded to low.",

  "details": [
    "The netmask package before 2.0.1 for Node.js mishandles certain unexpected characters in an IP address string, such as an octal digit of 9. This (in some situations) allows attackers to bypass access control that is based on IP addresses. NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-28918."
