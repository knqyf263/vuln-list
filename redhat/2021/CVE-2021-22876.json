  "mitigation": "This issue can be avoided by using at least one of the following recommendations:\n* Do not enable automatic generation of Referer headers when redirects are followed. This functionality is not enabled by default.  In the curl command line tool, it is enabled using the -e ';auto' or --referer ';auto' command line options. In the libcurl library, it is enabled using the CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER option.\n* Do not include authentication credentials in URLs (in the form of https://username:password@example.com), use other methods to provide authentication credentials to curl / libcurl. For the curl command line tool, use -u or --user command line option. For the libcurl library, use CURLOPT_USERPWD or CURLOPT_USERNAME / CURLOPT_PASSWORD options.",

    "curl 7.1.1 to and including 7.75.0 is vulnerable to an \"Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor\" by leaking credentials in the HTTP Referer: header. libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the Referer: HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.",
