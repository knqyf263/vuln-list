The SPNEGO implementation used by BIND, which is a negotiation mechanism used by GSSAPI to support the secure exchange of keys used to verify the authenticity of communications between parties on a network, is subject to a buffer overflow attack. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
