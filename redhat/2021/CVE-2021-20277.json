  "statement": "The version of Samba shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) 3 is built with a private copy of ldb (LDAP-like embedded database) library which includes the vulnerable code. However, Samba shipped with RHGS 3 is not supported for use as an Active Directory Domain Controller and hence the impact has been lowered.",

  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Samba's libldb. Multiple, consecutive leading spaces in an LDAP attribute can lead to an out-of-bounds memory write, leading to a crash of the LDAP server process handling the request. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
