    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. Incorrect limits are enforced for pointer arithmetic operations which can be abused to perform out-of-bounds reads and writes in kernel memory, leading to local privilege escalation to root. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
