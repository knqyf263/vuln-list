  "statement": "The version of Ansible provided in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not contain the vulnerable bitbucket module and is not affected by this vulnerability. However, Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of Ansible. The prerequisite is to enable the Ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of Ansible, which includes bug and security fixes.",

    "A flaw was found in ansible-collection where credentials are disclosed in the console log by default and not protected by the security feature when using the bitbucket_pipeline_variable module. This flaw allows an attacker to steal bitbucket_pipeline credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality."
