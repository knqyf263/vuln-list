This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-prismjs library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is low.\nAdditionally, OCP 3.11 is in maintenance support for low and moderate impact vulnerabilities, hence the OCP 3.11 grafana container has also been set OOSS.\nSince OpenShift Service Mesh 1.1.x is in its maintenance phase, only Important and Criticals will be fixed at this time.",

  "details": [
    "Prism is a syntax highlighting library. Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24. As a workaround, do not use ASCIIDoc or ERB to highlight untrusted text. Other languages are not affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.",
