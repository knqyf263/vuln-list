  "details": [
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's seq_file in the Filesystem layer. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to gain access to out-of-bound memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The issue results from not validating the size_t-to-int conversion prior to performing operations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality and system availability."
