  "statement": "To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted RPM.  It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs from trusted repositories. This flaw does not affect RPM as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 or 7.",

    "A flaw was found in the RPM package in the read functionality. This flaw allows an attacker who can convince a victim to install a seemingly verifiable package, whose signature header was modified, to cause RPM database corruption. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability."
