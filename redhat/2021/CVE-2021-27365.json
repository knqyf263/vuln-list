  "mitigation": "The LIBISCSI module will be auto-loaded when required, its use can be disabled  by preventing the module from loading with the following instructions:\n# echo \"install libiscsi /bin/true\" \u003e\u003e /etc/modprobe.d/disable-libiscsi.conf\nThe system will need to be restarted if the libiscsi modules are loaded. In most circumstances, the libiscsi kernel modules will be unable to be unloaded while any network interfaces are active and the protocol is in use.\nIf the system requires iscsi to work correctly, this mitigation may not be suitable.\nIf you need further assistance, see KCS article https://access.redhat.com/solutions/41278 or contact Red Hat Global Support Services.",

  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. Certain iSCSI data structures do not have appropriate length constraints or checks, and can exceed the PAGE_SIZE value. An unprivileged user can send a Netlink message that is associated with iSCSI, and has a length up to the maximum length of a Netlink message.",
    "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A heap buffer overflow in the iSCSI subsystem is triggered by setting an iSCSI string attribute to a value larger than one page and then trying to read it. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
