  "statement": "The impact of this flaw largely depends on the environment where the affected library is being used. This flaw could be used to redirect an adversary to an exposed, unprotected endpoint. Depending on the functionality of the affected endpoint that could result in a loss of confidentiality, integrity and availability.\nThe affected library is used in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes only in the development and build processes. Consequently the severity of this flaw to RHACM is downgraded to low.",

  "details": [
    "Improper input validation of octal strings in netmask npm package v1.0.6 and below allows unauthenticated remote attackers to perform indeterminate SSRF, RFI, and LFI attacks on many of the dependent packages. A remote unauthenticated attacker can bypass packages relying on netmask to filter IPs and reach critical VPN or LAN hosts.",
    "A flaw was found in nodejs-netmask. Octal input data may lead to a server-side request forgery, remote file inclusion, local file inclusion, and other vulnerabilities. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity."
