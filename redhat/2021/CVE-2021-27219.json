  "statement": "Applications that just use GBytes to access the data are affected by this flaw but the highest threat is to data confidentiality and/or the application availability, due to possible out-of-bounds reads. However, if the data in GBytes is taken through functions such as g_bytes_unref_to_data or g_bytes_unref_to_array it might be possible to have out-of-bounds writes due to the wrongly reported size of the buffer.\nApplications that use g_memdup to duplicate memory with user-controlled sizes should pay extra attention to the fact that g_memdup accepts a guint size instead of gsize. Thus directly passing a gsize value to g_memdup may results in integer truncation, allocating a buffer smaller than expected.",

  "details": [
    "An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.6 and 2.67.x before 2.67.3. The function g_bytes_new has an integer overflow on 64-bit platforms due to an implicit cast from 64 bits to 32 bits. The overflow could potentially lead to memory corruption."
