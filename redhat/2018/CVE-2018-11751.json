    "Previous versions of Puppet Agent didn't verify the peer in the SSL connection prior to downloading the CRL. This issue is resolved in Puppet Agent 6.4.0.",
    "A flaw was found in Puppet, where the Puppet Agent did not verify the peer in the SSL connection before downloading to the Certificate Revocation List (CRL).  The primary risk is the availability of communications to computing systems and not Puppet itself. This flaw allows an attacker to submit a phony CRL, potentially denying future automation of systems driven by Puppet."
