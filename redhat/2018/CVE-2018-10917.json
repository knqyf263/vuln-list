  "details": [
    "pulp 2.16.x and possibly older is vulnerable to an improper path parsing. A malicious user or a malicious iso feed repository can write to locations accessible to the 'apache' user. This may lead to overwrite of published content on other iso repositories.",
    "A path traversal flaw was found in the ISO repository plugin for pulp. An attacker, with access to a repository feeding pulp can carefully craft his repository to overwrite arbitrary files owned by the Apache webserver."
