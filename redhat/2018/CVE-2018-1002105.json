  "cwe": "CWE-305",
  "statement": "In versions 3.6 and higher of OpenShift Container Platform, this vulnerability allows cluster-admin level access to any API hosted by an aggregated API server. This includes the ‘service catalog’ API which is installed by default in 3.7 and later. Cluster-admin level access to the service catalog allows creation of brokered services by an unauthenticated user with escalated privileges in any namespace and on any node. This could lead to an attacker being allowed to deploy malicious code, or alter existing services.",

  "name": "CVE-2018-1002105",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "In all Kubernetes versions prior to v1.10.11, v1.11.5, and v1.12.3, incorrect handling of error responses to proxied upgrade requests in the kube-apiserver allowed specially crafted requests to establish a connection through the Kubernetes API server to backend servers, then send arbitrary requests over the same connection directly to the backend, authenticated with the Kubernetes API server's TLS credentials used to establish the backend connection.",
    "A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in OpenShift Container Platform which allows for compromise of pods running co-located on a compute node. This access could include access to all secrets, pods, environment variables, running pod/container processes, and persistent volumes, including in privileged containers."
