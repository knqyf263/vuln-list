  "name": "CVE-2019-0231",
  "document_distribution": "",
  "details": [
    "Handling of the close_notify SSL/TLS message does not lead to a connection closure, leading the server to retain the socket opened and to have the client potentially receive clear text messages afterward. Mitigation: 2.0.20 users should migrate to 2.0.21, 2.1.0 users should migrate to 2.1.1. This issue affects: Apache MINA.",
    "A cryptographic protocol integrity flaw was discovered in Apache Mina. The closure of a TLS session would not always result in closure of the socket, allowing the conversation to continue in clear text. This could undermine the confidentiality of a connection and potentially disclose sensitive information to third-party attackers."
