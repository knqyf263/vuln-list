  "details": [
    "A sandbox bypass vulnerability exists in Pipeline: Groovy Plugin 2.61 and earlier in src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/cps/CpsFlowDefinition.java, src/main/java/org/jenkinsci/plugins/workflow/cps/CpsGroovyShellFactory.java that allows attackers with Overall/Read permission to provide a pipeline script to an HTTP endpoint that can result in arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins master JVM.",
    "A flaw was found in Jenkins Pipeline. In the Declarative plugin, the script sandbox protection could be circumvented during the script compilation phase by applying AST. Both the pipeline validation REST APIs and the actual script/pipeline execution are affected. This allows users with Overall/Read permissions, or those able to control Jenkinsfile or the sandboxed Pipeline shared library contents in SCM, to bypass sandbox protection and execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
