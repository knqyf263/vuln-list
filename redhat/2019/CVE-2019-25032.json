    "Unbound before 1.9.5 allows an integer overflow in the regional allocator via regional_alloc.",
    "A flaw was found in unbound. An integer overflow in regional_alloc function may lead to a buffer overflow of the allocated buffer if the size can be controlled by an attacker and can be big enough. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as service availability."
