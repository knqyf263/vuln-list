  "Description": "There's a flaw in OpenEXR's deep tile sample size calculations in versions before 3.0.0-beta. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to be processed by OpenEXR could trigger an integer overflow, subsequently leading to an out-of-bounds read. The greatest risk of this flaw is to application availability.",
