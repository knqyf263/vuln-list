      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3244\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ownCloud, a cloud storage\nweb service for files, music, contacts, calendars and many more.\nHugh Davenport discovered that the \u003cq\u003econtacts\u003c/q\u003e application shipped\n    with ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site\n    scripting attacks. This vulnerability is effectively exploitable\n    in any browser.\nRoy Jansen discovered that the \u003cq\u003edocuments\u003c/q\u003e application shipped with\n    ownCloud is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting\n    attacks. This vulnerability is not exploitable in browsers that\n    support the current CSP standard.\nLukas Reschke discovered a blacklist bypass vulnerability, allowing\n    authenticated remote attackers to bypass the file blacklist and\n    upload files such as the .htaccess files. An attacker could leverage\n    this bypass by uploading a .htaccess and execute arbitrary PHP code\n    if the /data/ directory is stored inside the web root and a web\n    server that interprets .htaccess files is used. On default Debian\n    installations the data directory is outside of the web root and thus\n    this vulnerability is not exploitable by default.\n"
