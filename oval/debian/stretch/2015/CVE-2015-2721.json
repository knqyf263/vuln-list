    "Description": "Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.19, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 39.0, Firefox ESR 31.x before 31.8 and 38.x before 38.1, Thunderbird before 38.1, and other products, does not properly determine state transitions for the TLS state machine, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms by blocking messages, as demonstrated by removing a forward-secrecy property by blocking a ServerKeyExchange message, aka a \"SMACK SKIP-TLS\" issue.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3336\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in nss, the Mozilla Network\nSecurity Service library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handles state\n    transitions for the TLS state machine. A man-in-the-middle attacker\n    could exploit this flaw to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and\n    remove the forward-secrecy property.\nWatson Ladd discovered that NSS does not properly perform Elliptical\n    Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication, allowing a remote attacker\n    to potentially spoof ECDSA signatures.\n"
