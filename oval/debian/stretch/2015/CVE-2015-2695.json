    "Description": "lib/gssapi/spnego/spnego_mech.c in MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.14 relies on an inappropriate context handle, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (incorrect pointer read and process crash) via a crafted SPNEGO packet that is mishandled during a gss_inquire_context call.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3395\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation\nof Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()\n    on a partially-established SPNEGO context can cause the GSS-API\n    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n    process crash.\nIt was discovered that applications which call gss_inquire_context()\n    on a partially-established IAKERB context can cause the GSS-API\n    library to read from a pointer using the wrong type, leading to a\n    process crash.\nIt was discovered that the build_principal_va() function incorrectly\n    handles input strings. An authenticated attacker can take advantage\n    of this flaw to cause a KDC to crash using a TGS request with a\n    large realm field beginning with a null byte.\n"
