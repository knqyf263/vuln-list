    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in mod_auth_mellon before v0.14.2. An open redirect in the logout URL allows requests with backslashes to pass through by assuming that it is a relative URL, while the browsers silently convert backslash characters into forward slashes treating them as an absolute URL. This mismatch allows an attacker to bypass the redirect URL validation logic in apr_uri_parse function.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4414\nSeveral issues have been discovered in Apache module auth_mellon, which\nprovides SAML 2.0 authentication.\nIt was possible to bypass the redirect URL checking on logout, so\n    the module could be used as an open redirect facility.\nWhen mod_auth_mellon is used in an Apache configuration which\n    serves as a remote proxy with the http_proxy module, it was\n    possible to bypass authentication by sending SAML ECP headers.\n"
