    "Description": "The EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) before 2.8 and wpa_supplicant (EAP peer) before 2.8 does not validate fragmentation reassembly state properly for a case where an unexpected fragment could be received. This could result in process termination due to a NULL pointer dereference (denial of service). This affects eap_server/eap_server_pwd.c and eap_peer/eap_pwd.c.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4450\nA vulnerability was found in the WPA protocol implementation found in\nwpa_supplication (station) and hostapd (access point).\nThe EAP-pwd implementation in hostapd (EAP server) and wpa_supplicant (EAP\npeer) doesn't properly validate fragmentation reassembly state when receiving\nan unexpected fragment. This could lead to a process crash due to a NULL\npointer derefrence.\nAn attacker in radio range of a station or access point with EAP-pwd support\ncould cause a crash of the relevant process (wpa_supplicant or hostapd),\nensuring a denial of service.\n"
