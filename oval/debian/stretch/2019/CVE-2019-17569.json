    "Description": "The refactoring present in Apache Tomcat 9.0.28 to 9.0.30, 8.5.48 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.98 to 7.0.99 introduced a regression. The result of the regression was that invalid Transfer-Encoding headers were incorrectly processed leading to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy is considered unlikely.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4673\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Tomcat servlet and JSP\nengine, which could result in HTTP request smuggling and code execution\nin the AJP connector (disabled by default in Debian).\n"
