    "Description": "An integer underflow issue exists in ntfs-3g 2017.3.23. A local attacker could potentially exploit this by running /bin/ntfs-3g with specially crafted arguments from a specially crafted directory to cause a heap buffer overflow, resulting in a crash or the ability to execute arbitrary code. In installations where /bin/ntfs-3g is a setuid-root binary, this could lead to a local escalation of privileges.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4413\nA heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in NTFS-3G, a read-write\nNTFS driver for FUSE. A local user can take advantage of this flaw for\nlocal root privilege escalation.\n"
