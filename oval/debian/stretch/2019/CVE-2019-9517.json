    "Description": "Some HTTP/2 implementations are vulnerable to unconstrained interal data buffering, potentially leading to a denial of service. The attacker opens the HTTP/2 window so the peer can send without constraint; however, they leave the TCP window closed so the peer cannot actually write (many of) the bytes on the wire. The attacker then sends a stream of requests for a large response object. Depending on how the servers queue the responses, this can consume excess memory, CPU, or both.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4509\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\nJonathan Looney reported that a malicious client could perform a\n    denial of service attack (exhausting h2 workers) by flooding a\n    connection with requests and basically never reading responses on\n    the TCP connection.\nCraig Young reported that HTTP/2 PUSHes could lead to an overwrite\n    of memory in the pushing request's pool, leading to crashes.\nCraig Young reported that the HTTP/2 session handling could be made\n    to read memory after being freed, during connection shutdown.\nMatei \u003cq\u003eMal\u003c/q\u003e Badanoiu reported a limited cross-site scripting\n    vulnerability in the mod_proxy error page.\nDaniel McCarney reported that when mod_remoteip was configured to\n    use a trusted intermediary proxy server using the \u003cq\u003ePROXY\u003c/q\u003e protocol,\n    a specially crafted PROXY header could trigger a stack buffer\n    overflow or NULL pointer deference. This vulnerability could only be\n    triggered by a trusted proxy and not by untrusted HTTP clients. The\n    issue does not affect the stretch release.\nYukitsugu Sasaki reported a potential open redirect vulnerability in\n    the mod_rewrite module.\n"
