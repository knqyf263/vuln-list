    "Description": "With pipelining enabled each incoming query on a TCP connection requires a similar resource allocation to a query received via UDP or via TCP without pipelining enabled. A client using a TCP-pipelined connection to a server could consume more resources than the server has been provisioned to handle. When a TCP connection with a large number of pipelined queries is closed, the load on the server releasing these multiple resources can cause it to become unresponsive, even for queries that can be answered authoritatively or from cache. (This is most likely to be perceived as an intermittent server problem).",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4689\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation.\nIt was discovered that TCP-pipelined queries can bypass tcp-client\n    limits resulting in denial of service.\nIt was discovered that BIND does not sufficiently limit the number\n    of fetches performed when processing referrals. An attacker can take\n    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service (performance\n    degradation) or use the recursing server in a reflection attack with\n    a high amplification factor.\nIt was discovered that a logic error in the code which checks TSIG\n    validity can be used to trigger an assertion failure, resulting in\n    denial of service.\n"
