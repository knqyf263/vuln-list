    "Description": "It was found that in ghostscript some privileged operators remained accessible from various places after the CVE-2019-6116 fix. A specially crafted PostScript file could use this flaw in order to, for example, have access to the file system outside of the constrains imposed by -dSAFER. Ghostscript versions before 9.27 are vulnerable.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4442\nA vulnerability was discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL PostScript/PDF\ninterpreter, which may result in denial of service or the execution of\narbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed (despite the\n-dSAFER sandbox being enabled).\n"
