    "Description": "In Artifex Ghostscript through 9.25, the setpattern operator did not properly validate certain types. A specially crafted PostScript document could exploit this to crash Ghostscript or, possibly, execute arbitrary code in the context of the Ghostscript process. This is a type confusion issue because of failure to check whether the Implementation of a pattern dictionary was a structure type.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4346\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Ghostscript, the GPL\nPostScript/PDF interpreter, which may result in denial of service or the\nexecution of arbitrary code if a malformed Postscript file is processed\n(despite the -dSAFER sandbox being enabled).\nThis update rebases ghostscript for stretch to the upstream version 9.26\nwhich includes additional changes.\n"
