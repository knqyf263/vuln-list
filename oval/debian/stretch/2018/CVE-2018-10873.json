    "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in SPICE before version 0.14.1 where the generated code used for demarshalling messages lacked sufficient bounds checks. A malicious client or server, after authentication, could send specially crafted messages to its peer which would result in a crash or, potentially, other impacts.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4319\nFrediano Ziglio reported a missing check in the script to generate\ndemarshalling code in the SPICE protocol client and server library. The\ngenerated demarshalling code is prone to multiple buffer overflows. An\nauthenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial\nof service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute arbitrary code.\n"
