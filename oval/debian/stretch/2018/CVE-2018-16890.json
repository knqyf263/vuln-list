    "Description": "libcurl versions from 7.36.0 to before 7.64.0 is vulnerable to a heap buffer out-of-bounds read. The function handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages (`lib/vauth/ntlm.c:ntlm_decode_type2_target`) does not validate incoming data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability. Using that overflow, a malicious or broken NTLM server could trick libcurl to accept a bad length + offset combination that would lead to a buffer read out-of-bounds.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4386\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.\nWenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team discovered that the function\n    handling incoming NTLM type-2 messages does not validate incoming\n    data correctly and is subject to an integer overflow vulnerability,\n    which could lead to an out-of-bounds buffer read.\nWenxiang Qian of Tencent Blade Team discovered that the function\n    creating an outgoing NTLM type-3 header is subject to an integer\n    overflow vulnerability, which could lead to an out-of-bounds write.\nBrian Carpenter of Geeknik Labs discovered that the code handling\n    the end-of-response for SMTP is subject to an out-of-bounds heap\n    read.\n"
