    "Description": "An issue was discovered in xenvif_set_hash_mapping in drivers/net/xen-netback/hash.c in the Linux kernel through 4.18.1, as used in Xen through 4.11.x and other products. The Linux netback driver allows frontends to control mapping of requests to request queues. When processing a request to set or change this mapping, some input validation (e.g., for an integer overflow) was missing or flawed, leading to OOB access in hash handling. A malicious or buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in one or more of privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), or information leaks.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4313\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nFelix Wilhelm of Google Project Zero discovered a flaw in the hash\n    handling of the xen-netback Linux kernel module. A malicious or\n    buggy frontend may cause the (usually privileged) backend to make\n    out of bounds memory accesses, potentially resulting in privilege\n    escalation, denial of service, or information leaks.\n\u003curl \"https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-270.html\" /\u003e\nIt was discovered that the KVM subsystem on the arm64 platform does\n    not properly handle the KVM_SET_ON_REG ioctl. An attacker who can\n    create KVM based virtual machines can take advantage of this flaw\n    for denial of service (hypervisor panic) or privilege escalation\n    (arbitrarily redirect the hypervisor flow of control with full\n    register control).\n"
