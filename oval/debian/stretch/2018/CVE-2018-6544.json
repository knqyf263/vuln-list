      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4152\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in MuPDF, a PDF, XPS, and e-book\nviewer, which may result in denial of service or remote code execution.\nAn attacker can craft a PDF document which, when opened in the victim\nhost, might consume vast amounts of memory, crash the program, or, in\nsome cases, execute code in the context in which the application is\nrunning.\n"
