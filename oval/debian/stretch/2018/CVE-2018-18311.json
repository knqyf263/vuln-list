The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJayakrishna Menon and Christophe Hauser discovered an integer\n    overflow vulnerability in Perl_my_setenv leading to a heap-based\n    buffer overflow with attacker-controlled input.\nEiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could\n    cause a heap-based buffer overflow write during compilation,\n    potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.\nEiichi Tsukata discovered that a crafted regular expression could\n    cause a heap-based buffer overflow read during compilation which\n    leads to information leak.\nJakub Wilk discovered that a specially crafted regular expression\n    could lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.\n"
