    "Description": "In stroke_socket.c in strongSwan before 5.6.3, a missing packet length check could allow a buffer underflow, which may lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service while reading from the socket.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4229\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec suite.\nThe stroke plugin did not verify the message length when reading from its\n    control socket. This vulnerability could lead to denial of service. On\n    Debian write access to the socket requires root permission on default\n    configuration.\nA missing variable initialization in IKEv2 key derivation could lead to a\n    denial of service (crash of the charon IKE daemon) if the openssl plugin is\n    used in FIPS mode and the negotiated PRF is HMAC-MD5.\n"
