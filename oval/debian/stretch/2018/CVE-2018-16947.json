    "Description": "An issue was discovered in OpenAFS before 1.6.23 and 1.8.x before 1.8.2. The backup tape controller (butc) process accepts incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow for) authentication of those RPCs. Handling those RPCs results in operations being performed with administrator credentials, including dumping/restoring volume contents and manipulating the backup database. For example, an unauthenticated attacker can replace any volume's content with arbitrary data.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4302\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in openafs, an implementation of\nthe distributed filesystem AFS. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJeffrey Altman reported that the backup tape controller (butc)\n    process does accept incoming RPCs but does not require (or allow\n    for) authentication of those RPCs, allowing an unauthenticated\n    attacker to perform volume operations with administrator\n    credentials.\n\u003curl \"https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-001.txt\" /\u003e\nMark Vitale reported that several RPC server routines do not fully\n    initialize output variables, leaking memory contents (from both\n    the stack and the heap) to the remote caller for\n    otherwise-successful RPCs.\n\u003curl \"https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-002.txt\" /\u003e\nMark Vitale reported that an unauthenticated attacker can consume\n    large amounts of server memory and network bandwidth via\n    specially crafted requests, resulting in denial of service to\n    legitimate clients.\n\u003curl \"https://openafs.org/pages/security/OPENAFS-SA-2018-003.txt\" /\u003e\n"
