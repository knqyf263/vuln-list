    "Description": "kernel KVM before versions kernel 4.16, kernel 4.16-rc7, kernel 4.17-rc1, kernel 4.17-rc2 and kernel 4.17-rc3 is vulnerable to a flaw in the way the Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor handled exceptions delivered after a stack switch operation via Mov SS or Pop SS instructions. During the stack switch operation, the processor did not deliver interrupts and exceptions, rather they are delivered once the first instruction after the stack switch is executed. An unprivileged KVM guest user could use this flaw to crash the guest or, potentially, escalate their privileges in the guest.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4196\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the KVM implementation did not\n    properly handle #DB exceptions while deferred by MOV SS/POP SS,\n    allowing an unprivileged KVM guest user to crash the guest or\n    potentially escalate their privileges.\nNick Peterson of Everdox Tech LLC discovered that #DB exceptions\n    that are deferred by MOV SS or POP SS are not properly handled,\n    allowing an unprivileged user to crash the kernel and cause a denial\n    of service.\n"
