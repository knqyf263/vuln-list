    "Description": "The Linux kernel, versions 3.9+, is vulnerable to a denial of service attack with low rates of specially modified packets targeting IP fragment re-assembly. An attacker may cause a denial of service condition by sending specially crafted IP fragments. Various vulnerabilities in IP fragmentation have been discovered and fixed over the years. The current vulnerability (CVE-2018-5391) became exploitable in the Linux kernel with the increase of the IP fragment reassembly queue size.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4272\nJuha-Matti Tilli discovered a flaw in the way the Linux kernel\n    handled reassembly of fragmented IPv4 and IPv6 packets. A remote\n    attacker can take advantage of this flaw to trigger time and\n    calculation expensive fragment reassembly algorithms by sending\n    specially crafted packets, leading to remote denial of service.\nThis is mitigated by reducing the default limits on memory usage\n    for incomplete fragmented packets.  The same mitigation can be\n    achieved without the need to reboot, by setting the sysctls:\nThe default values may still be increased by local configuration\n    if necessary.\n"
