    "Description": "Ansible 2.5 prior to 2.5.5, and 2.4 prior to 2.4.5, do not honor the no_log task flag for failed tasks. When the no_log flag has been used to protect sensitive data passed to a task from being logged, and that task does not run successfully, Ansible will expose sensitive data in log files and on the terminal of the user running Ansible.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4396\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in Ansible, a configuration\nmanagement, deployment, and task execution system:\nThe no_log task flag wasn't honored, resulting in an information leak.\nansible.cfg was read from the current working directory.\nThe user module leaked parameters passed to ssh-keygen to the process\n    environment.\nThe fetch module was susceptible to path traversal.\n"
