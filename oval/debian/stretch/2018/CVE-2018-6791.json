    "Description": "An issue was discovered in soliduiserver/deviceserviceaction.cpp in KDE Plasma Workspace before 5.12.0. When a vfat thumbdrive that contains `` or $() in its volume label is plugged in and mounted through the device notifier, it's interpreted as a shell command, leading to a possibility of arbitrary command execution. An example of an offending volume label is \"$(touch b)\" -- this will create a file called b in the home folder.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4116\nKrzysztof Sieluzycki discovered that the notifier for removable devices\nin the KDE Plasma workspace performed insufficient sanitisation of\nFAT/VFAT volume labels, which could result in the execution of arbitrary\nshell commands if a removable device with a malformed disk label is\nmounted.\n"
