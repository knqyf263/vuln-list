      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3882\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an\nextensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to a cross-site\n    scripting (XSS) attack if an attacker uploads a malicious file with\n    a certain content type. Installations which use the\n    AlwaysDownloadAttachments config setting are unaffected by this\n    flaw. The applied fix addresses all existant and future uploaded\n    attachments.\nIt was discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to timing\n    side-channel attacks for user passwords.\nIt was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to an information\n    leak of cross-site request forgery (CSRF) verification tokens if a\n    user is tricked into visiting a specially crafted URL by an\n    attacker.\nIt was discovered that Request Tracker is prone to a remote code\n    execution vulnerability in the dashboard subscription interface. A\n    privileged attacker can take advantage of this flaw through\n    carefully-crafted saved search names to cause unexpected code to be\n    executed. The applied fix addresses all existant and future saved\n    searches.\nAdditionally to the above mentioned CVEs, this update workarounds\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-7686\"\u003eCVE-2015-7686\u003c/a\u003e\nin Email::Address which could induce a denial of service\nof Request Tracker itself.\n"
