    "Description": "In Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0 to 2.4.23, mod_session_crypto was encrypting its data/cookie using the configured ciphers with possibly either CBC or ECB modes of operation (AES256-CBC by default), hence no selectable or builtin authenticated encryption. This made it vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, particularly with CBC.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3796\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Apache2 HTTP server.\nRedTeam Pentesting GmbH discovered that mod_session_crypto was\n  vulnerable to padding oracle attacks, which could allow an attacker\n  to guess the session cookie.\nMaksim Malyutin discovered that malicious input to mod_auth_digest\n  could cause the server to crash, causing a denial of service.\nDavid Dennerline, of IBM Security's X-Force Researchers, and RĂŠgis\n  Leroy discovered problems in the way Apache handled a broad pattern\n  of unusual whitespace patterns in HTTP requests. In some\n  configurations, this could lead to response splitting or cache\n  pollution vulnerabilities.  To fix these issues, this update makes\n  Apache httpd be more strict in what HTTP requests it accepts.\nIf this causes problems with non-conforming clients, some checks can\n  be relaxed by adding the new directive \u003cq\u003eHttpProtocolOptions unsafe\u003c/q\u003e\n  to the configuration.\nThis update also fixes the issue where mod_reqtimeout was not enabled\nby default on new installations.\n"
