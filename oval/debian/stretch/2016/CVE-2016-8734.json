    "Description": "Apache Subversion's mod_dontdothat module and HTTP clients 1.4.0 through 1.8.16, and 1.9.0 through 1.9.4 are vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack caused by exponential XML entity expansion. The attack can cause the targeted process to consume an excessive amount of CPU resources or memory.",

This allowed an\n    attacker to run an arbitrary shell command, for instance via\n    svn:externals properties or when using \u003cq\u003esvnsync sync\u003c/q\u003e.\n"
