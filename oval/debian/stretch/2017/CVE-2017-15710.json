    "Description": "In Apache httpd 2.0.23 to 2.0.65, 2.2.0 to 2.2.34, and 2.4.0 to 2.4.29, mod_authnz_ldap, if configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, uses the Accept-Language header value to lookup the right charset encoding when verifying the user's credentials. If the header value is not present in the charset conversion table, a fallback mechanism is used to truncate it to a two characters value to allow a quick retry (for example, 'en-US' is truncated to 'en'). A header value of less than two characters forces an out of bound write of one NUL byte to a memory location that is not part of the string. In the worst case, quite unlikely, the process would crash which could be used as a Denial of Service attack. In the more likely case, this memory is already reserved for future use and the issue has no effect at all.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4164\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\nAlex Nichols and Jakob Hirsch reported that mod_authnz_ldap, if\n    configured with AuthLDAPCharsetConfig, could cause an out of bound write\n    if supplied with a crafted Accept-Language header. This could\n    potentially be used for a Denial of Service attack.\nElar Lang discovered that expression specified in \u0026lt;FilesMatch\u0026gt; could\n    match '$' to a newline character in a malicious filename, rather\n    than matching only the end of the filename. This could be exploited\n    in environments where uploads of some files are externally\n    blocked, but only by matching the trailing portion of the filename.\nWhen mod_session is configured to forward its session data to CGI\n    applications (SessionEnv on, not the default), a remote user could\n    influence their content by using a \u003cq\u003eSession\u003c/q\u003e header.\nRobert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted request could have\n    crashed the Apache HTTP Server, due to an out of bound access after\n    a size limit is reached by reading the HTTP header.\nRobert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP request header\n    could have crashed the Apache HTTP Server if using\n    mod_cache_socache, due to an out of bound read while preparing data\n    to be cached in shared memory.\nNicolas Daniels discovered that when generating an HTTP Digest\n    authentication challenge, the nonce sent by mod_auth_digest to\n    prevent replay attacks was not correctly generated using a\n    pseudo-random seed. In a cluster of servers using a common Digest\n    authentication configuration, HTTP requests could be replayed across\n    servers by an attacker without detection.\n"
