    "Description": "A specially crafted email delivered over SMTP and passed on to Dovecot by MTA can trigger an out of bounds read resulting in potential sensitive information disclosure and denial of service. In order to trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to send a specially crafted email message to the server.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4130\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Dovecot email\nserver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\nAleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos and \u003cq\u003eflxflndy\u003c/q\u003e discovered that\n    Dovecot does not properly parse invalid email addresses, which may\n    cause a crash or leak memory contents to an attacker.\nIt was discovered that TLS SNI config lookups may lead to excessive\n    memory usage, causing imap-login/pop3-login VSZ limit to be reached\n    and the process restarted, resulting in a denial of service. Only\n    Dovecot configurations containing \u003ccode\u003elocal_name { }\u003c/code\u003e or \u003ccode\u003elocal { }\u003c/code\u003e\n    configuration blocks are affected.\nIt was discovered that Dovecot contains a memory leak flaw in the\n    login process on aborted SASL authentication.\n"
