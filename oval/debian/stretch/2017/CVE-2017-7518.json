    "Description": "A flaw was found in the Linux kernel before version 4.12 in the way the KVM module processed the trap flag(TF) bit in EFLAGS during emulation of the syscall instruction, which leads to a debug exception(#DB) being raised in the guest stack. A user/process inside a guest could use this flaw to potentially escalate their privileges inside the guest. Linux guests are not affected by this.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3981\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that KVM is prone to an incorrect debug\n    exception (#DB) error occurring while emulating a syscall\n    instruction. A process inside a guest can take advantage of this\n    flaw for privilege escalation inside a guest.\nStefano Brivio of Red Hat discovered that the SCTP subsystem is\n    prone to a data leak vulnerability due to an out-of-bounds read\n    flaw, allowing to leak up to 100 uninitialized bytes to userspace.\nDmitry Vyukov of Google reported that the timerfd facility does\n    not properly handle certain concurrent operations on a single file\n    descriptor.  This allows a local attacker to cause a denial of\n    service or potentially execute arbitrary code.\nBo Zhang reported that the xfrm subsystem does not properly\n    validate one of the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability can use this to cause a denial\n    of service or potentially to execute arbitrary code.\nJan H. Schoenherr of Amazon discovered that when Linux is running\n    in a Xen PV domain on an x86 system, it may incorrectly merge\n    block I/O requests.  A buggy or malicious guest may trigger this\n    bug in dom0 or a PV driver domain, causing a denial of service or\n    potentially execution of arbitrary code.\nThis issue can be mitigated by disabling merges on the underlying\n    back-end block devices, e.g.:\n        \u003ccode\u003eecho 2 \u003e /sys/block/nvme0n1/queue/nomerges\u003c/code\u003e\nAdrian Salido of Google reported a race condition in access to the\n    \u003cq\u003edriver_override\u003c/q\u003e attribute for platform devices in sysfs. If\n    unprivileged users are permitted to access this attribute, this\n    might allow them to gain privileges.\nBo Zhang reported that the cfg80211 (wifi) subsystem does not\n    properly validate the parameters to a netlink message. Local users\n    with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability (in any user namespace with a\n    wifi device) can use this to cause a denial of service.\nJim Mattson of Google reported that the KVM implementation for\n    Intel x86 processors did not correctly handle certain nested\n    hypervisor configurations. A malicious guest (or nested guest in a\n    suitable L1 hypervisor) could use this for denial of service.\nAndrey Konovalov discovered that a user-triggerable division by\n    zero in the tcp_disconnect() function could result in local denial\n    of service.\nOtto Ebeling reported that the move_pages() system call performed\n    insufficient validation of the UIDs of the calling and target\n    processes, resulting in a partial ASLR bypass. This made it easier\n    for local users to exploit vulnerabilities in programs installed\n    with the set-UID permission bit set.\n\u003cq\u003esohu0106\u003c/q\u003e reported an information leak in the atyfb video driver.\n    A local user with access to a framebuffer device handled by this\n    driver could use this to obtain sensitive information.\nRichard Wareing discovered that the XFS implementation allows the\n    creation of files with the \u003cq\u003erealtime\u003c/q\u003e flag on a filesystem with no\n    realtime device, which can result in a crash (oops). A local user\n    with access to an XFS filesystem that does not have a realtime\n    device can use this for denial of service.\nChunYu Wang of Red Hat discovered that the iSCSI subsystem does not\n    properly validate the length of a netlink message, leading to\n    memory corruption. A local user with permission to manage iSCSI\n    devices can use this for denial of service or possibly to execute\n    arbitrary code.\nBenjamin Poirier of SUSE reported that vnet headers are not\n    properly handled within the tpacket_rcv() function in the raw\n    packet (af_packet) feature. A local user with the CAP_NET_RAW\n    capability can take advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of\n    service (buffer overflow, and disk and memory corruption) or have\n    other impact.\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition in the raw\n    packet (af_packet) feature. Local users with the CAP_NET_RAW\n    capability can use this for denial of service or possibly to\n    execute arbitrary code.\nAndrey Konovalov of Google reported a race condition flaw in the\n    UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) code. A local user can use this\n    flaw for denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code.\nArmis Labs discovered that the Bluetooth subsystem does not\n    properly validate L2CAP configuration responses, leading to a\n    stack buffer overflow. This is one of several vulnerabilities\n    dubbed \u003cq\u003eBlueborne\u003c/q\u003e. A nearby attacker can use this to cause a\n    denial of service or possibly to execute arbitrary code on a\n    system with Bluetooth enabled.\nJan H. Schoenherr of Amazon reported that the KVM implementation\n    for Intel x86 processors did not correctly validate interrupt\n    injection requests. A local user with permission to use KVM could\n    use this for denial of service.\nThe Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument or\n    environment list can result in ASLR bypass for 32-bit PIE binaries.\nThe Qualys Research Labs reported that a large argument\n    or environment list can result in a stack/heap clash for 32-bit\n    PIE binaries.\nAlexander Potapenko of Google reported a race condition in the ALSA\n    (sound) timer driver, leading to an information leak. A local user\n    with permission to access sound devices could use this to obtain\n    sensitive information.\nDebian disables unprivileged user namespaces by default, but if they\nare enabled (via the kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone sysctl) then\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-11600\"\u003eCVE-2017-11600\u003c/a\u003e, \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-14497\"\u003eCVE-2017-14497\u003c/a\u003e and \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2017-1000111\"\u003eCVE-2017-1000111\u003c/a\u003e \ncan be exploited by any local user.\n"
