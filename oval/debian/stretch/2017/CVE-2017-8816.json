    "Description": "The NTLM authentication feature in curl and libcurl before 7.57.0 on 32-bit platforms allows attackers to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and resultant buffer overflow, and application crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact via vectors involving long user and password fields.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4051\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in cURL, an URL transfer library.\nAlex Nichols discovered a buffer overrun flaw in the NTLM authentication\n    code which can be triggered on 32bit systems where an integer overflow\n    might occur when calculating the size of a memory allocation.\nFuzzing by the OSS-Fuzz project led to the discovery of a read out of\n    bounds flaw in the FTP wildcard function in libcurl. A malicious server\n    could redirect a libcurl-based client to an URL using a wildcard pattern,\n    triggering the out-of-bound read.\n"
