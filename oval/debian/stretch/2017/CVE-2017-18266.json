    "Description": "The open_envvar function in xdg-open in xdg-utils before 1.1.3 does not validate strings before launching the program specified by the BROWSER environment variable, which might allow remote attackers to conduct argument-injection attacks via a crafted URL, as demonstrated by %s in this environment variable.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4211\nGabriel Corona discovered that xdg-utils, a set of tools for desktop\nenvironment integration, is vulnerable to argument injection attacks. If\nthe environment variable BROWSER in the victim host has a \"%s\" and the\nvictim opens a link crafted by an attacker with xdg-open, the malicious\nparty could manipulate the parameters used by the browser when opened.\nThis manipulation could set, for example, a proxy to which the network\ntraffic could be intercepted for that particular execution.\n"
