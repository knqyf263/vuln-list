The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the\nfollowing issues:\nA use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Exim's routines\n    responsible for parsing mail headers. A remote attacker can take\n    advantage of this flaw to cause Exim to crash, resulting in a denial\n    of service, or potentially for remote code execution.\nIt was discovered that Exim does not properly handle BDAT data\n    headers allowing a remote attacker to cause Exim to crash, resulting\n    in a denial of service.\n"
