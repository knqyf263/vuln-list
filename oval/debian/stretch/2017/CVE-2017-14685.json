    "Description": "Artifex MuPDF 1.11 allows attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a crafted .xps file, related to \"Data from Faulting Address controls Branch Selection starting at mupdf+0x000000000016aa61\" on Windows. This occurs because xps_load_links_in_glyphs in xps/xps-link.c does not verify that an xps font could be loaded.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4006\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in MuPDF, a PDF file viewer, which\nmay result in denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.\nWangLin discovered that a crafted .xps file can crash MuPDF and\n     potentially execute arbitrary code in several ways, since the\n     application makes unchecked assumptions on the entry format.\nTerry Chia and Jeremy Heng discovered an integer overflow that can\n    cause arbitrary code execution via a crafted .pdf file.\n"
