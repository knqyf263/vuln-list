    "Description": "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command in the podcast playback function of Podbeuter in Newsbeuter 0.3 through 2.9 allows remote attackers to perform user-assisted code execution by crafting an RSS item with a media enclosure (i.e., a podcast file) that includes shell metacharacters in its filename, related to pb_controller.cpp and queueloader.cpp, a different vulnerability than CVE-2017-12904.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3977\nIt was discovered that podbeuter, the podcast fetcher in newsbeuter, a\ntext-mode RSS feed reader, did not properly escape the name of the media\nenclosure (the podcast file), allowing a remote attacker to run an\narbitrary shell command on the client machine. This is only exploitable\nif the file is also played in podbeuter.\n"
