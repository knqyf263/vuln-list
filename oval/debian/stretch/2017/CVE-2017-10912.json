      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3969\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:\nJann Horn discovered that incorrectly handling of page transfers might\n    result in privilege escalation.\nJann Horn discovered that race conditions in grant handling might\n    result in information leaks or privilege escalation.\nAndrew Cooper discovered that incorrect reference counting with\n    shadow paging might result in privilege escalation.\nAndrew Cooper discovered an information leak in the handling\n    of the Memory Protection Extensions (MPX) and Protection\n    Key (PKU) CPU features. This only affects Debian stretch.\nAnkur Arora discovered a NULL pointer dereference in event\n    polling, resulting in denial of service.\nJulien Grall discovered that incorrect error handling in\n    physical-to-machine memory mappings may result in privilege\n    escalation, denial of service or an information leak.\nJulien Grall discovered that incorrect handling of\n    virtual interrupt injection on ARM systems may result in\n    denial of service.\nJan Beulich discovered multiple places where reference\n    counting on grant table operations was incorrect, resulting\n    in potential privilege escalation.\nJan Beulich found multiple problems in the handling of\n    transitive grants which could result in denial of service\n    and potentially privilege escalation.\nIan Jackson discovered that race conditions in the allocator\n    for grant mappings may result in denial of service or privilege\n    escalation. This only affects Debian stretch.\nAndrew Cooper discovered that incorrect validation of\n    grants may result in privilege escalation.\nJan Beulich discovered that incorrect grant status handling, thus\n    incorrectly informing the guest that the grant is no longer in use.\nWei Liu discovered that incorrect locking of add-to-physmap\n    operations on ARM may result in denial of service.\n"
