      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4078\nMultiple researchers have discovered a vulnerability in Intel processors,\nenabling an attacker controlling an unprivileged process to read memory from\narbitrary addresses, including from the kernel and all other processes running\non the system.\nThis specific attack has been named Meltdown and is addressed in the Linux\nkernel for the Intel x86-64 architecture by a patch set named Kernel Page Table\nIsolation, enforcing a near complete separation of the kernel and userspace\naddress maps and preventing the attack. This solution might have a performance\nimpact, and can be disabled at boot time by passing \u003ccode\u003epti=off\u003c/code\u003e to the \nkernel command line.\nWe also identified a regression for ancient userspaces using the vsyscall\ninterface, for example chroot and containers using (e)glibc 2.13 and older,\nincluding those based on Debian 7 or RHEL/CentOS 6. This regression will be\nfixed in a later update.\nThe other vulnerabilities (named Spectre) published at the same time are not\naddressed in this update and will be fixed in a later update.\n"
