    "Description": "The try_read_command function in memcached.c in memcached before 1.4.39 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (segmentation fault) via a request to add/set a key, which makes a comparison between signed and unsigned int and triggers a heap-based buffer over-read. NOTE: this vulnerability exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2016-8705.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4218\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in memcached, a high-performance\nmemory object caching system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nDaniel Shapira reported a heap-based buffer over-read in memcached\n    (resulting from an incomplete fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2016-8705\"\u003eCVE-2016-8705\u003c/a\u003e) triggered by\n    specially crafted requests to add/set a key and allowing a remote\n    attacker to cause a denial of service.\nIt was reported that memcached listens to UDP by default. A remote\n    attacker can take advantage of it to use the memcached service as a\n    DDoS amplifier.\nDefault installations of memcached in Debian are not affected by\n    this issue as the installation defaults to listen only on localhost.\n    This update disables the UDP port by default. Listening on the UDP\n    can be re-enabled in the /etc/memcached.conf (cf.\n    /usr/share/doc/memcached/NEWS.Debian.gz).\nAn integer overflow was reported in memcached, resulting in resource\n    leaks, data corruption, deadlocks or crashes.\n"
