    "Description": "GNOME Nautilus before 3.23.90 allows attackers to spoof a file type by using the .desktop file extension, as demonstrated by an attack in which a .desktop file's Name field ends in .pdf but this file's Exec field launches a malicious \"sh -c\" command. In other words, Nautilus provides no UI indication that a file actually has the potentially unsafe .desktop extension; instead, the UI only shows the .pdf extension. One (slightly) mitigating factor is that an attack requires the .desktop file to have execute permission. The solution is to ask the user to confirm that the file is supposed to be treated as a .desktop file, and then remember the user's answer in the metadata::trusted field.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3994\nChristian BoxdĂśrfer discovered a vulnerability in the handling of\nFreeDesktop.org .desktop files in Nautilus, a file manager for the GNOME\ndesktop environment. An attacker can craft a .desktop file intended to run\nmalicious commands but displayed as a innocuous document file in Nautilus. An\nuser would then trust it and open the file, and Nautilus would in turn execute\nthe malicious content. Nautilus protection of only trusting .desktop files with\nexecutable permission can be bypassed by shipping the .desktop file inside a\ntarball.\n"
