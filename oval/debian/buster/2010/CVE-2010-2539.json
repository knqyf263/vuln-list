      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2079\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in mapserver, a CGI-based\nweb framework to publish spatial data and interactive mapping applications.\nThe Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following\nproblems:\nA stack-based buffer overflow in the msTmpFile function might lead to\n  arbitrary code execution under some conditions.\nIt was discovered that the CGI debug command-line arguments which are\n  enabled by default are insecure and may allow a remote attacker to\n  execute arbitrary code. Therefore they have been disabled by default.\n"
