    "Description": "The gmp plugin in strongSwan before 5.5.3 does not properly validate RSA public keys before calling mpz_powm_sec, which allows remote peers to cause a denial of service (floating point exception and process crash) via a crafted certificate.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3866\nTwo denial of service vulnerabilities were identified in strongSwan, an\nIKE/IPsec suite, using Google's OSS-Fuzz fuzzing project.\nRSA public keys passed to the gmp plugin aren't validated sufficiently\n    before attempting signature verification, so that invalid input might\n    lead to a floating point exception and crash of the process.\n    A certificate with an appropriately prepared public key sent by a peer\n    could be used for a denial-of-service attack.\nASN.1 CHOICE types are not correctly handled by the ASN.1 parser when\n    parsing X.509 certificates with extensions that use such types. This could\n    lead to infinite looping of the thread parsing a specifically crafted\n    certificate.\nA fix for a build failure was additionally included in the 5.2.1-6+deb8u4\nrevision of the strongSwan package.\n"
