    "Description": "In Apache httpd 2.2.x before 2.2.33 and 2.4.x before 2.4.26, use of the ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to authentication requirements being bypassed.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3896\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in the Apache HTTPD server.\nEmmanuel Dreyfus reported that the use of ap_get_basic_auth_pw() by\n    third-party modules outside of the authentication phase may lead to\n    authentication requirements being bypassed.\nVasileios Panopoulos of AdNovum Informatik AG discovered that\n    mod_ssl may dereference a NULL pointer when third-party modules call\n    ap_hook_process_connection() during an HTTP request to an HTTPS port\n    leading to a denial of service.\nRobert Swiecki reported that a specially crafted HTTP/2 request\n    could cause mod_http2 to dereference a NULL pointer and crash the\n    server process.\nJavier Jimenez reported that the HTTP strict parsing contains a\n    flaw leading to a buffer overread in ap_find_token(). A remote\n    attacker can take advantage of this flaw by carefully crafting a\n    sequence of request headers to cause a segmentation fault, or to\n    force ap_find_token() to return an incorrect value.\nChenQin and Hanno Boeck reported that mod_mime can read one byte\n    past the end of a buffer when sending a malicious Content-Type\n    response header.\n"
