    "Description": "libffi requests an executable stack allowing attackers to more easily trigger arbitrary code execution by overwriting the stack. Please note that libffi is used by a number of other libraries. It was previously stated that this affects libffi version 3.2.1 but this appears to be incorrect. libffi prior to version 3.1 on 32 bit x86 systems was vulnerable, and upstream is believed to have fixed this issue in version 3.1.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3889\nlibffi, a library used to call code written in one language from code written\nin a different language, was enforcing an executable stack on the i386\narchitecture. While this might not be considered a vulnerability by itself,\nthis could be leveraged when exploiting other vulnerabilities, like for example\nthe \u003cq\u003estack clash\u003c/q\u003e class of vulnerabilities discovered by Qualys Research Labs.\nFor the full details, please refer to their advisory published at:\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt\"\u003ehttps://www.qualys.com/2017/06/19/stack-clash/stack-clash.txt\u003c/a\u003e\n"
