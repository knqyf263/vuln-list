    "Description": "kpac/script.cpp in KDE kio before 5.32 and kdelibs before 4.14.30 calls the PAC FindProxyForURL function with a full https URL (potentially including Basic Authentication credentials, a query string, or PATH_INFO), which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3849\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in kde4libs, the core libraries\nfor all KDE 4 applications. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nItzik Kotler, Yonatan Fridburg and Amit Klein of Safebreach Labs\n    reported that URLs are not sanitized before passing them to\n    FindProxyForURL, potentially allowing a remote attacker to obtain\n    sensitive information via a crafted PAC file.\nSebastian Krahmer from SUSE discovered that the KAuth framework\n    contains a logic flaw in which the service invoking dbus is not\n    properly checked. This flaw allows spoofing the identity of the\n    caller and gaining root privileges from an unprivileged account.\n"
