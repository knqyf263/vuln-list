    "Description": "A use-after-free vulnerability was found in network namespaces code affecting the Linux kernel before 4.14.11. The function get_net_ns_by_id() in net/core/net_namespace.c does not check for the net::count value after it has found a peer network in netns_ids idr, which could lead to double free and memory corruption. This vulnerability could allow an unprivileged local user to induce kernel memory corruption on the system, leading to a crash. Due to the nature of the flaw, privilege escalation cannot be fully ruled out, although it is thought to be unlikely.",
