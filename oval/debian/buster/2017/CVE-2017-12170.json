    "Description": "Downstream version 1.0.46-1 of pure-ftpd as shipped in Fedora was vulnerable to packaging error due to which the original configuration was ignored after update and service started running with default configuration. This has security implications because of overriding security-related configuration. This issue doesn't affect upstream version of pure-ftpd.",
