      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2549\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in devscripts, a set of\nscripts to make the life of a Debian Package maintainer easier.\nThe following Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project ids have\nbeen assigned to identify them:\nRaphael Geissert discovered that dscverify does not perform\n    sufficient validation and does not properly escape arguments to\n    external commands, allowing a remote attacker (as when dscverify is\n    used by dget) to execute arbitrary code.\nRaphael Geissert discovered that dget allows an attacker to delete\n    arbitrary files when processing a specially-crafted .dsc or\n    .changes file, due to insuficient input validation.\nRaphael Geissert discovered that dget does not properly escape\n    arguments to external commands when processing .dsc and .changes\n    files, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n    This issue is limited with the fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-2241\"\u003eCVE-2012-2241\u003c/a\u003e, and had\n    already been fixed in version 2.10.73 due to changes to the code,\n    without considering its security implications.\nJim Meyering, Red Hat, discovered that annotate-output determines\n    the name of temporary named pipes in a way that allows a local\n    attacker to make it abort, leading to denial of service.\nAdditionally, a regression in the exit code of debdiff introduced in\n\u003ca href=\"dsa-2409\"\u003eDSA-2409-1\u003c/a\u003e has been fixed.\n"
