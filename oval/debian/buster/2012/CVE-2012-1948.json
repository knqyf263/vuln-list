      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2528\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Icedove, Debian's version\nof the Mozilla Thunderbird mail and news client.\nMultiple unspecified vulnerabilities in the browser engine\n\twere fixed.\nThe underlying browser engine allows address bar spoofing \n\tthrough drag-and-drop.\nA use-after-free vulnerability in the nsDocument::AdoptNode\n\tfunction allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n\t(heap memory corruption) or possibly execute arbitrary code.\nAn error in the implementation of the JavaScript sandbox\n\tallows execution of JavaScript code with improper privileges\n\tusing javascript: URLs.\nDSA-2514\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Iceweasel, a web browser \nbased on Firefox. The included XULRunner library provides rendering services for \nseveral other applications included in Debian.\nBenoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, and Bill McCloskey\n    identified several memory safety problems that may lead to the execution of \n    arbitrary code.\nMario Gomes and Code Audit Labs discovered that it is possible to force \n    Iceweasel to display the URL of the previous entered site through drag and \n    drop actions to the address bar. This can be abused to perform phishing \n    attacks.\nAbhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free problem in \n    nsDocument::AdoptNode that may lead to the execution of arbitrary \n    code.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered that it is possible to perform cross-site\n    scripting attacks through the context menu when using data: URLs.\n\u003cq\u003emoz_bug_r_a4\u003c/q\u003e discovered that in certain cases, javascript: URLs can\n    be executed so that scripts can escape the JavaScript sandbox and run\n    with elevated privileges.\nNote: We'd like to advise users of Iceweasel's 3.5 branch in Debian stable to \nconsider to upgrade to the Iceweasel 10.0 ESR (Extended Support Release) which \nis now available in Debian Backports. Although Debian will continue to support \nIceweasel 3.5 in stable with security updates, this can only be done on a best \neffort basis as upstream provides no such support anymore. On top of that, the \n10.0 branch adds proactive security features to the browser.\n"
