    "Description": "SQL injection vulnerability in the Active Record component in Ruby on Rails before 3.0.18, 3.1.x before 3.1.9, and 3.2.x before 3.2.10 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via a crafted request that leverages incorrect behavior of dynamic finders in applications that can use unexpected data types in certain find_by_ method calls.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2597\njoernchen of Phenoelit discovered that rails, an MVC ruby based framework\ngeared for web application development, is not properly treating\nuser-supplied input to \u003cq\u003efind_by_*\u003c/q\u003e methods. Depending on how the\nruby on rails application is using these methods, this allows an attacker\nto perform SQL injection attacks, e.g., to bypass authentication if\nAuthlogic is used and the session secret token is known.\n"
