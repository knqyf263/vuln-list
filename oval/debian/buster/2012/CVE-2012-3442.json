      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2529\nJeroen Dekkers and others reported several vulnerabilities in Django,\na Python Web framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject defines the following issues:\nTwo functions do not validate the scheme of a redirect target,\n    which might allow remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting\n    (XSS) attacks via a data: URL.\nThe ImageField class completely decompresses image data during image\n    validation, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service\n    (memory consumption) by uploading an image file.\nThe get_image_dimensions function in the image-handling functionality\n    uses a constant chunk size in all attempts to determine dimensions,\n    which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (process\n    or thread consumption) via a large TIFF image.\n"
