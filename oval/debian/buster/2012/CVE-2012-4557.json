    "Description": "The mod_proxy_ajp module in the Apache HTTP Server 2.2.12 through 2.2.21 places a worker node into an error state upon detection of a long request-processing time, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (worker consumption) via an expensive request.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2579\nA vulnerability has been found in the Apache HTTPD Server:\nA flaw was found when mod_proxy_ajp connects to a backend\n\tserver that takes too long to respond. Given a specific\n\tconfiguration, a remote attacker could send certain requests,\n\tputting a backend server into an error state until the retry\n\ttimeout expired. This could lead to a temporary denial of\n\tservice.\nIn addition, this update also adds a server side mitigation for the\nfollowing issue:\nIf using SSL/TLS data compression with HTTPS in an connection\n\tto a web browser, man-in-the-middle attackers may obtain\n\tplaintext HTTP headers. This issue is known as the \u003cq\u003eCRIME\u003c/q\u003e\n\tattack. This update of apache2 disables SSL compression by\n\tdefault. A new SSLCompression directive has been backported\n\tthat may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in\n\tenvironments where the \u003cq\u003eCRIME\u003c/q\u003e attack is not an issue.\n\tFor more information, please refer to the \u003ca\n\thref=\"https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression\"\u003eSSLCompression\n\tDirective documentation\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
