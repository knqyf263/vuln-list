    "Description": "libpcp in Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) before 3.6.5 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code via (1) a PDU with the numcreds field value greater than the number of actual elements to the __pmDecodeCreds function in p_creds.c; (2) the string byte number value to the __pmDecodeNameList function in p_pmns.c; (3) the numids value to the __pmDecodeIDList function in p_pmns.c; (4) unspecified vectors to the __pmDecodeProfile function in p_profile.c; the (5) status number value or (6) string number value to the __pmDecodeNameList function in p_pmns.c; (7) certain input to the __pmDecodeResult function in p_result.c; (8) the name length field (namelen) to the DecodeNameReq function in p_pmns.c; (9) a crafted PDU_FETCH request to the __pmDecodeFetch function in p_fetch.c; (10) the namelen field in the __pmDecodeInstanceReq function in p_instance.c; (11) the buflen field to the __pmDecodeText function in p_text.c; (12) PDU_INSTANCE packets to the __pmDecodeInstance in p_instance.c; or the (13) c_numpmid or (14) v_numval fields to the __pmDecodeLogControl function in p_lcontrol.c, which triggers integer overflows, heap-based buffer overflows, and/or buffer over-reads.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2533\nIt was discovered that Performance Co-Pilot (pcp), a framework for\nperformance monitoring, contains several vulnerabilities.\nMultiple buffer overflows in the PCP protocol decoders can\n\tcause PCP clients and servers to crash or, potentially,\n\texecute arbitrary code while processing crafted PDUs.\nThe \u003cq\u003elinux\u003c/q\u003e PMDA used by the pmcd daemon discloses sensitive\n\tinformation from the /proc file system to unauthenticated\n\tclients.\nMultiple memory leaks processing crafted requests can cause\n\tpmcd to consume large amounts of memory and eventually crash.\nIncorrect event-driven programming allows malicious clients to\n\tprevent other clients from accessing the pmcd daemon.\nTo address the information disclosure vulnerability, \n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-3419\"\u003eCVE-2012-3419\u003c/a\u003e, a\nnew \u003cq\u003eproc\u003c/q\u003e PMDA was introduced, which is disabled by default.
