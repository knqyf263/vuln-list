The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that the permissions of a function called by a\n   trigger are not checked. This could result in privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that only the first 32 characters of a host name\n   are checked when validating host names through SSL certificates.\n   This could result in spoofing the connection in limited\n   circumstances.\nIt was discovered that pg_dump did not sanitise object names.\n   This could result in arbitrary SQL command execution if a\n   malformed dump file is opened.\n"
