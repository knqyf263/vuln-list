    "Description": "Buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in ospf_packet.c in the OSPFv2 implementation in ospfd in Quagga before 0.99.20.1 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than the length specified in its header.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2459\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Quagga, a routing\ndaemon.\nA buffer overflow in the ospf_ls_upd_list_lsa function in the\n    OSPFv2 implementation allows remote attackers to cause a\n    denial of service (assertion failure and daemon exit) via a\n    Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet that is smaller than\n    the length specified in its header.\nA buffer overflow in the OSPFv2 implementation allows remote\n    attackers to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) via a\n    Link State Update (aka LS Update) packet containing a\n    network-LSA link-state advertisement for which the\n    data-structure length is smaller than the value in the Length\n    header field.\nThe BGP implementation does not properly use message buffers\n    for OPEN messages, which allows remote attackers impersonating\n    a configured BGP peer to cause a denial of service (assertion\n    failure and daemon exit) via a message associated with a\n    malformed AS4 capability.\nThis security update upgrades the quagga package to the most recent\nupstream release.  This release includes other corrections, such as\nhardening against unknown BGP path attributes.\n"
