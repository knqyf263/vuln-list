    "Description": "radsecproxy before 1.6.1 does not properly verify certificates when there are configuration blocks with CA settings that are unrelated to the block being used for verifying the certificate chain, which might allow remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions and spoof clients.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2573\nRalf Paffrath reported that Radsecproxy, a RADIUS protocol proxy, mixed up \npre- and post-handshake verification of clients. This vulnerability may\nwrongly accept clients without checking their certificate chain under \ncertain configurations.\nRaphael Geissert spotted that the fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4523\"\u003eCVE-2012-4523\u003c/a\u003e was incomplete, \ngiving origin to \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2012-4566\"\u003eCVE-2012-4566\u003c/a\u003e. Both vulnerabilities are fixed with this \nupdate.\nNotice that this fix may make Radsecproxy reject some clients that are \ncurrently (erroneously) being accepted.\n"
