      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2394\nMany security problems have been fixed in libxml2, a popular library to handle\nXML data files.\nJĂźri Aedla discovered a heap-based buffer overflow that allows remote attackers\nto cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via\nunknown vectors.\nAn Off-by-one error have been discovered that allows remote attackers to\nexecute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.\nA memory corruption (double free) bug has been identified in libxml2's XPath\nengine. Through it, it is possible for an attacker to cause a denial of\nservice or possibly have unspecified other impact. This vulnerability does not\naffect the oldstable distribution (lenny).\nYang Dingning discovered a double free vulnerability related to XPath handling.\nAn out-of-bounds read vulnerability had been discovered, which allows remote\nattackers to cause a denial of service.\n"
