    "Description": "The DTLS implementation in OpenSSL before 0.9.8s and 1.x before 1.0.0f performs a MAC check only if certain padding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers to recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2390\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, an implementation\nof TLS and related protocols.  The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following vulnerabilities:\nThe DTLS implementation performs a MAC check only if certain\n\tpadding is valid, which makes it easier for remote attackers\n\tto recover plaintext via a padding oracle attack.\nA double free vulnerability when X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK is\n\tenabled, allows remote attackers to cause applications crashes\n\tand potentially allow execution of arbitrary code by\n\ttriggering failure of a policy check.\nOn 32-bit systems, the operations on NIST elliptic curves\n\tP-256 and P-384 are not correctly implemented, potentially\n\tleaking the private ECC key of a TLS server.  (Regular\n\tRSA-based keys are not affected by this vulnerability.)\nThe SSL 3.0 implementation does not properly initialize data\n\tstructures for block cipher padding, which might allow remote\n\tattackers to obtain sensitive information by decrypting the\n\tpadding data sent by an SSL peer.\nThe Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) implementation in OpenSSL\n\tdoes not properly handle handshake restarts, unnecessarily\n\tsimplifying CPU exhaustion attacks.\n"
