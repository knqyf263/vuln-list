      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2220\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Request Tracker, an issue tracking\nsystem.\nIf the external custom field feature is enabled, Request Tracker\n    allows authenticated users to execute arbitrary code with the\n    permissions of the web server, possible triggered by a cross-site\n    request forgery attack.  (External custom fields are disabled by\n    default.)\nMultiple SQL injection attacks allow authenticated users to obtain\n    data from the database in an unauthorized way.\nAn information leak allows an authenticated privileged user to\n    obtain sensitive information, such as encrypted passwords, via the\n    search interface.\nWhen running under certain web servers (such as Lighttpd), Request\n    Tracker is vulnerable to a directory traversal attack, allowing\n    attackers to read any files accessible to the web server.  Request\n    Tracker instances running under Apache or Nginx are not affected.\nRequest Tracker contains multiple cross-site scripting\n    vulnerabilities.\nRequest Tracker enables attackers to redirect authentication\n    credentials supplied by legitimate users to third-party servers.\n"
