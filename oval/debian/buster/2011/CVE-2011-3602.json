    "Description": "Directory traversal vulnerability in device-linux.c in the router advertisement daemon (radvd) before 1.8.2 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files, and remote attackers to overwrite certain files, via a .. (dot dot) in an interface name.  NOTE: this can be leveraged with a symlink to overwrite arbitrary files.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2323\nMultiple security issues were discovered by Vasiliy Kulikov in radvd, an\nIPv6 Router Advertisement daemon:\nset_interface_var() function doesn't check the interface name, which is\n   chosen by an unprivileged user. This could lead to an arbitrary file\n   overwrite if the attacker has local access, or specific files overwrites\n   otherwise.\nprocess_ra() function lacks multiple buffer length checks which could\n   lead to memory reads outside the stack, causing a crash of the daemon.\nprocess_rs() function calls mdelay() (a function to wait for a defined\n   time) unconditionnally when running in unicast-only mode. As this call\n   is in the main thread, that means all request processing is delayed (for\n   a time up to MAX_RA_DELAY_TIME, 500 ms by default). An attacker could\n   flood the daemon with router solicitations in order to fill the input\n   queue, causing a temporary denial of service (processing would be\n   stopped during all the mdelay() calls).\n\u003cbr/\u003e\n   Note: upstream and Debian default is to use anycast mode.\n"
