The iceape\npackage only provides the XPCOM code.\nDSA-2273\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Icedove, an unbranded\nversion of the Thunderbird mail/news client.\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e discovered two use-after-frees in SVG processing,\n   which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e discovered a use-after-free in XUL processing, which\n   could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDavid Chan discovered that cookies were insufficiently isolated.\nChris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow in the\n   Javascript engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary\n   code.\nMartin Barbella discovered a use-after-free in XUL processing,\n   which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nBob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and\n   Christian Biesinger discovered memory corruption bugs, which may\n   lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nLuke Wagner and Gary Kwong discovered memory corruption bugs, which\n   may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nAs indicated in the Lenny (oldstable) release notes, security support for\nthe Icedove packages in the oldstable needed to be stopped before the end\nof the regular Lenny security maintenance life cycle.\nYou are strongly encouraged to upgrade to stable or switch to a different\nmail client.\nDSA-2268\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in Iceweasel, a web browser\nbased on Firefox:\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e discovered two use-after-frees in SVG processing, which\n   could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n\u003cq\u003eregenrecht\u003c/q\u003e discovered a use-after-free in XUL processing, which\n   could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nDavid Chan discovered that cookies were insufficiently isolated.\nChris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow in the\n   JavaScript engine, which could lead to the execution of arbitrary\n   code.\nMartin Barbella discovered a use-after-free in XUL processing,\n   which could lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nBob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Nils, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman and\n   Christian Biesinger discovered memory corruption bugs, which may\n   lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\nLuke Wagner and Gary Kwong discovered memory corruption bugs, which\n   may lead to the execution of arbitrary code.\n"
