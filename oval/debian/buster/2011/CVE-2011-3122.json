As the CVEs were allocated from releases announcements and\nspecific fixes are usually not identified, it has been decided to\nupgrade the wordpress package to the latest upstream version instead\nof backporting the patches.\nThis means extra care should be taken when upgrading, especially when\nusing third-party plugins or themes, since compatibility may have been\nimpacted along the way.  We recommend that users check their install\nbefore doing the upgrade.\n"
