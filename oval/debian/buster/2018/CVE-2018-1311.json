    "Description": "The Apache Xerces-C 3.0.0 to 3.2.3 XML parser contains a use-after-free error triggered during the scanning of external DTDs. This flaw has not been addressed in the maintained version of the library and has no current mitigation other than to disable DTD processing. This can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard parser feature, or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4814\nIt was discovered that xerces-c, a validating XML parser library for\nC++, did not correctly scan DTDs. The use-after-free vulnerability\nresulting from this issue would allow a remote attacker to leverage a\nspecially crafted XML file in order to crash the application or\npotentially execute arbitrary code.\nPlease note that the patch fixing this issue comes at the expense of a\nnewly introduced memory leak.\n"
