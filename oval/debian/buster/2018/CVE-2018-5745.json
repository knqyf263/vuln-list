    "Description": "\"managed-keys\" is a feature which allows a BIND resolver to automatically maintain the keys used by trust anchors which operators configure for use in DNSSEC validation. Due to an error in the managed-keys feature it is possible for a BIND server which uses managed-keys to exit due to an assertion failure if, during key rollover, a trust anchor's keys are replaced with keys which use an unsupported algorithm. Versions affected: BIND 9.9.0 -\u003e 9.10.8-P1, 9.11.0 -\u003e 9.11.5-P1, 9.12.0 -\u003e 9.12.3-P1, and versions 9.9.3-S1 -\u003e 9.11.5-S3 of BIND 9 Supported Preview Edition. Versions 9.13.0 -\u003e 9.13.6 of the 9.13 development branch are also affected. Versions prior to BIND 9.9.0 have not been evaluated for vulnerability to CVE-2018-5745.",
