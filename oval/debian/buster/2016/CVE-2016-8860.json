    "Description": "Tor before 0.2.8.9 and 0.2.9.x before 0.2.9.4-alpha had internal functions that were entitled to expect that buf_t data had NUL termination, but the implementation of or/buffers.c did not ensure that NUL termination was present, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (client, hidden service, relay, or authority crash) via crafted data.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3694\nIt has been discovered that Tor treats the contents of some buffer\nchunks as if they were a NUL-terminated string.  This issue could\nenable a remote attacker to crash a Tor client, hidden service, relay,\nor authority.\n"
