    "Description": "An issue has been found in PowerDNS Authoritative Server versions up to and including 3.4.10, 4.0.1 allowing an authorized user to crash the server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone under their control then sending a DNS query for that record. The issue is due to an integer overflow when checking if the content of the record matches the expected size, allowing an attacker to cause a read past the buffer boundary.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3764\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in pdns, an authoritative\nDNS server. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nMathieu Lafon discovered that pdns does not properly validate\n    records in zones. An authorized user can take advantage of this flaw\n    to crash server by inserting a specially crafted record in a zone\n    under their control and then sending a DNS query for that record.\nFlorian Heinz and Martin Kluge reported that pdns parses all records\n    present in a query regardless of whether they are needed or even\n    legitimate, allowing a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause an\n    abnormal CPU usage load on the pdns server, resulting in a partial\n    denial of service if the system becomes overloaded.\nMongo discovered that the webserver in pdns is susceptible to a\n    denial-of-service vulnerability, allowing a remote, unauthenticated\n    attacker to cause a denial of service by opening a large number of TCP\n    connections to the web server.\nMongo discovered that pdns does not sufficiently validate TSIG\n    signatures, allowing an attacker in position of man-in-the-middle to\n    alter the content of an AXFR.\n"
