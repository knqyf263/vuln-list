    "Description": "A vulnerability was discovered in SPICE before 0.13.90 in the server's protocol handling. An authenticated attacker could send crafted messages to the SPICE server causing a heap overflow leading to a crash or possible code execution.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3790\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in spice, a SPICE protocol\nclient and server library. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered a buffer overflow\n    vulnerability in the main_channel_alloc_msg_rcv_buf function. An\n    authenticated attacker can take advantage of this flaw to cause a\n    denial of service (spice server crash), or possibly, execute\n    arbitrary code.\nFrediano Ziglio of Red Hat discovered that spice does not properly\n    validate incoming messages. An attacker able to connect to the\n    spice server could send crafted messages which would cause the\n    process to crash.\n"
