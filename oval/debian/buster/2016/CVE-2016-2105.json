    "Description": "Integer overflow in the EVP_EncodeUpdate function in crypto/evp/encode.c in OpenSSL before 1.0.1t and 1.0.2 before 1.0.2h allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a large amount of binary data.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3566\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL, a Secure Socket Layer\ntoolkit.\nGuido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function\n    EVP_EncodeUpdate(), used for Base64 encoding, if an attacker can\n    supply a large amount of data. This could lead to a heap corruption.\nGuido Vranken discovered that an overflow can occur in the function\n    EVP_EncryptUpdate() if an attacker can supply a large amount of data.\n    This could lead to a heap corruption.\nJuraj Somorovsky discovered a padding oracle in the AES CBC cipher\n    implementation based on the AES-NI instruction set. This could allow\n    an attacker to decrypt TLS traffic encrypted with one of the cipher\n    suites based on AES CBC.\nDavid Benjamin from Google discovered that two separate bugs in the\n    ASN.1 encoder, related to handling of negative zero integer values\n    and large universal tags, could lead to an out-of-bounds write.\nBrian Carpenter discovered that when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO\n    using functions such as d2i_CMS_bio(), a short invalid encoding can\n    cause allocation of large amounts of memory potentially consuming\n    excessive resources or exhausting memory.\nAdditional information about these issues can be found in the OpenSSL\nsecurity advisory at \u003ca href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt\"\u003ehttps://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20160503.txt\u003c/a\u003e\n"
