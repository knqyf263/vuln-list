    "Description": "Multiple integer overflows in libXpm before 3.5.12, when a program requests parsing XPM extensions on a 64-bit platform, allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) or execute arbitrary code via (1) the number of extensions or (2) their concatenated length in a crafted XPM file, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3772\nTobias Stoeckmann discovered that the libXpm library contained two\ninteger overflow flaws, leading to a heap out-of-bounds write, while\nparsing XPM extensions in a file. An attacker can provide a specially\ncrafted XPM file that, when processed by an application using the libXpm\nlibrary, would cause a denial-of-service against the application, or\npotentially, the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the\nuser running the application.\n"
