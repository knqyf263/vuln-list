    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x before 13.37.1, 16.x before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x before 18.0.1 and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. If Asterisk is challenged on an outbound INVITE and the nonce is changed in each response, Asterisk will continually send INVITEs in a loop. This causes Asterisk to consume more and more memory since the transaction will never terminate (even if the call is hung up), ultimately leading to a restart or shutdown of Asterisk. Outbound authentication must be configured on the endpoint for this to occur.",
