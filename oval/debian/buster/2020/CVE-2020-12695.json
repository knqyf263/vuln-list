      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4806\nIt was discovered that missing input validation in minidlna, a\nlightweight DLNA/UPnP-AV server could result in the execution of\narbitrary code. In addition minidlna was susceptible to the\n\u003cq\u003eCallStranger\u003c/q\u003e UPnP vulnerability.\nDSA-4898\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in wpa_supplicant and\nhostapd.\nIt was discovered that hostapd does not properly handle UPnP\n    subscribe messages under certain conditions, allowing an attacker to\n    cause a denial of service.\nIt was discovered that wpa_supplicant does not properly process P2P\n    (Wi-Fi Direct) group information from active group owners. An\n    attacker within radio range of the device running P2P could take\n    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially\n    execute arbitrary code.\nIt was discovered that wpa_supplicant does not properly process\n    P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. An attacker\n    within radio range of the device running P2P could take advantage\n    of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially execute\n    arbitrary code.\n"
