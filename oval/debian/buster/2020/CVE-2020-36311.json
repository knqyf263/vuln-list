    "Description": "An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.9. arch/x86/kvm/svm/sev.c allows attackers to cause a denial of service (soft lockup) by triggering destruction of a large SEV VM (which requires unregistering many encrypted regions), aka CID-7be74942f184.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4941\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nA flaw was discovered in the KVM subsystem for AMD CPUs, allowing an\n    attacker to cause a denial of service by triggering destruction of a\n    large SEV VM.\nNorbert Slusarek reported a race condition vulnerability in the CAN\n    BCM networking protocol, allowing a local attacker to escalate\n    privileges.\nThe Qualys Research Labs discovered a size_t-to-int conversion\n    vulnerability in the Linux kernel's filesystem layer. An\n    unprivileged local attacker able to create, mount, and then delete a\n    deep directory structure whose total path length exceeds 1GB, can\n    take advantage of this flaw for privilege escalation.\nDetails can be found in the Qualys advisory at\n    \u003ca href=\"https://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt\"\u003ehttps://www.qualys.com/2021/07/20/cve-2021-33909/sequoia-local-privilege-escalation-linux.txt\u003c/a\u003e\nNorbert Slusarek discovered an information leak in the CAN BCM\n    networking protocol. A local attacker can take advantage of this\n    flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory.\n"
