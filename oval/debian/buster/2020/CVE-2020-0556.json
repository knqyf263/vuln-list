    "Description": "Improper access control in subsystem for BlueZ before version 5.54 may allow an unauthenticated user to potentially enable escalation of privilege and denial of service via adjacent access",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4647\nIt was reported that the BlueZ's HID and HOGP profile implementations\ndon't specifically require bonding between the device and the host.\nMalicious devices can take advantage of this flaw to connect to a target\nhost and impersonate an existing HID device without security or to cause\nan SDP or GATT service discovery to take place which would allow HID\nreports to be injected to the input subsystem from a non-bonded source.\nFor the HID profile an new configuration option (ClassicBondedOnly) is\nintroduced to make sure that input connections only come from bonded\ndevice connections. The options defaults to \u003cq\u003efalse\u003c/q\u003e to maximize device\ncompatibility.\n"
