    "Description": "In QEMU through 5.0.0, an integer overflow was found in the SM501 display driver implementation. This flaw occurs in the COPY_AREA macro while handling MMIO write operations through the sm501_2d_engine_write() callback. A local attacker could abuse this flaw to crash the QEMU process in sm501_2d_operation() in hw/display/sm501.c on the host, resulting in a denial of service.",
