    "Description": "In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN response buffer is not initialized properly. There is a leak of information between different client connections. One client (an attacker) could use their connection to intelligently query coturn to get interesting bytes in the padding bytes from the connection of another client. This has been fixed in 4.5.1.3.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4711\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in coturn, a TURN and STUN\nserver for VoIP.\nFelix Doerre reported that the STUN response buffer was not properly\n    initialised, which could allow an attacker to leak bytes in the\n    padding bytes from the connection of another client.\nAleksandar Nikolic reported that a crafted HTTP POST request can\n    lead to information leaks and other misbehavior.\nAleksandar Nikolic reported that a crafted HTTP POST request can\n    lead to server crash and denial of service.\n"
