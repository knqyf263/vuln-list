    "Description": "The JSON gem through 2.2.0 for Ruby, as used in Ruby 2.4 through 2.4.9, 2.5 through 2.5.7, and 2.6 through 2.6.5, has an Unsafe Object Creation Vulnerability. This is quite similar to CVE-2013-0269, but does not rely on poor garbage-collection behavior within Ruby. Specifically, use of JSON parsing methods can lead to creation of a malicious object within the interpreter, with adverse effects that are application-dependent.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4721\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the\nRuby language.\nJeremy Evans reported an unsafe object creation vulnerability in the\n    json gem bundled with Ruby. When parsing certain JSON documents, the\n    json gem can be coerced into creating arbitrary objects in the\n    target system.\nSamuel Williams reported a flaw in the socket library which may lead\n    to exposure of possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.\n"
