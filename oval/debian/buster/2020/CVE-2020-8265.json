    "Description": "Node.js versions before 10.23.1, 12.20.1, 14.15.4, 15.5.1 are vulnerable to a use-after-free bug in its TLS implementation. When writing to a TLS enabled socket, node::StreamBase::Write calls node::TLSWrap::DoWrite with a freshly allocated WriteWrap object as first argument. If the DoWrite method does not return an error, this object is passed back to the caller as part of a StreamWriteResult structure. This may be exploited to corrupt memory leading to a Denial of Service or potentially other exploits.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4826\nTwo vulnerabilities were discovered in Node.js, which could result in\ndenial of service and potentially the execution of arbitrary code or\nHTTP request smuggling.\n"
