    "Description": "In ISC BIND9 versions BIND 9.11.14 -\u003e 9.11.19, BIND 9.14.9 -\u003e 9.14.12, BIND 9.16.0 -\u003e 9.16.3, BIND Supported Preview Edition 9.11.14-S1 -\u003e 9.11.19-S1: Unless a nameserver is providing authoritative service for one or more zones and at least one zone contains an empty non-terminal entry containing an asterisk (\"*\") character, this defect cannot be encountered. A would-be attacker who is allowed to change zone content could theoretically introduce such a record in order to exploit this condition to cause denial of service, though we consider the use of this vector unlikely because any such attack would require a significant privilege level and be easily traceable.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4752\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in BIND, a DNS server\nimplementation.\nIt was discovered that an asterisk character in an empty non    terminal can cause an assertion failure, resulting in denial\n    of service.\nDave Feldman, Jeff Warren, and Joel Cunningham reported that a\n    truncated TSIG response can lead to an assertion failure, resulting\n    in denial of service.\nLyu Chiy reported that a flaw in the native PKCS#11 code can lead\n    to a remotely triggerable assertion failure, resulting in denial\n    of service.\nJoop Boonen reported that update-policy rules of type \u003cq\u003esubdomain\u003c/q\u003e\n    are enforced incorrectly, allowing updates to all parts of the zone\n    along with the intended subdomain.\n"
