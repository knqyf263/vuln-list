    "Description": "Redcarpet is a Ruby library for Markdown processing. In Redcarpet before version 3.5.1, there is an injection vulnerability which can enable a cross-site scripting attack. In affected versions no HTML escaping was being performed when processing quotes. This applies even when the `:escape_html` option was being used. This is fixed in version 3.5.1 by the referenced commit.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4831\nJohan Smits discovered that ruby-redcarpet, a markdown parser, did not\nproperly validate its input. This would allow an attacker to mount a\ncross-site scripting attack.\n"
