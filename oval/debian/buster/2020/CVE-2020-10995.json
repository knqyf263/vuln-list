    "Description": "PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not sufficiently defend against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS protocol has been found that allow malicious parties to use recursive DNS services to attack third party authoritative name servers. The attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative name server to amplify the resulting traffic between the recursive and other authoritative name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded performance as an effect. This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS records. PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.16, 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a mitigation to limit the impact of this DNS protocol issue.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4691\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in PDNS Recursor, a resolving\nname server; a traffic amplification attack against third party\nauthoritative name servers (NXNSAttack) and insufficient validation of\nNXDOMAIN responses lacking an SOA.\nThe version of pdns-recursor in the oldstable distribution (stretch) is\nno longer supported. If these security issues affect your setup, you\nshould upgrade to the stable distribution (buster).\n"
