    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Dovecot before 2.3.13. By using IMAP IDLE, an authenticated attacker can trigger unhibernation via attacker-controlled parameters, leading to access to other users' email messages (and path disclosure).",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4825\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Dovecot email server.\nWhen imap hibernation is active, an attacker (with valid credentials\n    to access the mail server) can cause Dovecot to discover file system\n    directory structures and access other users' emails via specially\n    crafted commands.\nInnokentii Sennovskiy reported that the mail delivery and parsing in\n    Dovecot can crash when the 10000th MIME part is message/rfc822 (or\n    if the parent was multipart/digest). This flaw was introduced by\n    earlier changes addressing\n    \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12100\"\u003e\\\n    CVE-2020-12100\u003c/a\u003e.\n"
