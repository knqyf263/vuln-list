    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstored implementation, the internal representation of the tree has special cases for the root node, because this node has no parent. Unfortunately, permissions were not checked for certain operations on the root node. Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions, list, and delete the root node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a host-wide denial of service.) Achieving xenstore write access is also possible. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not vulnerable.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4812\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Xen hypervisor:\nSeveral security issues affecting Xenstore could result in cross\ndomain access (denial of service, information leaks or privilege\nescalation) or denial of service against xenstored.\nAdditional vulnerabilities could result in guest-to-host denial of\nservice.\n"
