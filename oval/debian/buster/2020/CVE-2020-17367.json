      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4742\nTim Starling discovered two vulnerabilities in firejail, a sandbox\nprogram to restrict the running environment of untrusted applications.\nIt was reported that firejail does not respect the end-of-options\n    separator (\"--\"), allowing an attacker with control over the command\n    line options of the sandboxed application, to write data to a\n    specified file.\nIt was reported that firejail when redirecting output via --output\n    or --output-stderr, concatenates all command line arguments into a\n    single string that is passed to a shell. An attacker who has control\n    over the command line arguments of the sandboxed application could\n    take advantage of this flaw to run arbitrary commands.\n"
