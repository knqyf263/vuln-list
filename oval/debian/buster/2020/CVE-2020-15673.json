    "Description": "Mozilla developers reported memory safety bugs present in Firefox 80 and Firefox ESR 78.2. Some of these bugs showed evidence of memory corruption and we presume that with enough effort some of these could have been exploited to run arbitrary code. This vulnerability affects Firefox \u003c 81, Thunderbird \u003c 78.3, and Firefox ESR \u003c 78.3.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4768\nMultiple security issues have been found in the Mozilla Firefox web\nbrowser, which could potentially result in the execution of arbitrary\ncode, cross-site scripting or spoofing the origin of a download.\nDebian follows the extended support releases (ESR) of Firefox. Support\nfor the 68.x series has ended, so starting with this update we're now\nfollowing the 78.x releases.\nBetween 68.x and 78.x, Firefox has seen a number of feature updates.\nFor more information please refer to\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/78.0esr/releasenotes/\"\u003e\\\nhttps://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/78.0esr/releasenotes/\u003c/a\u003e\nDSA-4770\nMultiple security issues have been found in Thunderbird, which may lead\nto the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.\nDebian follows the Thunderbird upstream releases. Support for the 68.x\nseries has ended, so starting with this update we're now following\nthe 78.x releases.\nThe 78.x series discontinues support for some addons.
