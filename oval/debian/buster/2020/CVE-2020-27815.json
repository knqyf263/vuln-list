      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4843\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nA flaw was reported in the JFS filesystem code allowing a local\n    attacker with the ability to set extended attributes to cause a\n    denial of service.\nAdam \u003cq\u003epi3\u003c/q\u003e Zabrocki reported a use-after-free flaw in the ftrace\n    ring buffer resizing logic due to a race condition, which could\n    result in denial of service or information leak.\nShisong Qin reported a NULL pointer dereference flaw in the Speakup\n    screen reader core driver.\nDavid Disseldorp discovered that the LIO SCSI target implementation\n    performed insufficient checking in certain XCOPY requests. An\n    attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial Number\n    assignments can take advantage of this flaw to read and write to any\n    LIO backstore, regardless of the SCSI transport settings.\nMichael Kurth and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported that frontends can\n    trigger OOM in backends by updating a watched path.\nOlivier Benjamin and Pawel Wieczorkiewicz reported a use-after-free\n    flaw which can be triggered by a block frontend in Linux blkback. A\n    misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously\n    connecting / disconnecting a block frontend.\nJann Horn reported a locking inconsistency issue in the tty\n    subsystem which may allow a local attacker to mount a\n    read-after-free attack against TIOCGSID.\nJann Horn reported a locking issue in the tty subsystem which can\n    result in a use-after-free. A local attacker can take advantage of\n    this flaw for memory corruption or privilege escalation.\nA buffer overflow flaw was discovered in the mwifiex WiFi driver\n    which could result in denial of service or the execution of\n    arbitrary code via a long SSID value.\nIt was discovered that PI futexes have a kernel stack use-after-free\n    during fault handling. An unprivileged user could use this flaw to\n    crash the kernel (resulting in denial of service) or for privilege\n    escalation.\nA flaw was discovered in the Linux implementation of string matching\n    within a packet. A privileged user (with root or CAP_NET_ADMIN) can\n    take advantage of this flaw to cause a kernel panic when inserting\n    iptables rules.\n"
