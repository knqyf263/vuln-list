    "Description": "An out-of-bounds access issue was found in the Linux kernel, all versions through 5.3, in the way Linux kernel's KVM hypervisor implements the Coalesced MMIO write operation. It operates on an MMIO ring buffer 'struct kvm_coalesced_mmio' object, wherein write indices 'ring-\u003efirst' and 'ring-\u003elast' value could be supplied by a host user-space process. An unprivileged host user or process with access to '/dev/kvm' device could use this flaw to crash the host kernel, resulting in a denial of service or potentially escalating privileges on the system.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4531\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nMatt Delco reported a race condition in KVM's coalesced MMIO\n    facility, which could lead to out-of-bounds access in the kernel.\n    A local attacker permitted to access /dev/kvm could use this to\n    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n    for privilege escalation.\nPeter Pi of Tencent Blade Team discovered a missing bounds check\n    in vhost_net, the network back-end driver for KVM hosts, leading\n    to a buffer overflow when the host begins live migration of a VM.\n    An attacker in control of a VM could use this to cause a denial of\n    service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly for privilege\n    escalation on the host.\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported a missing bounds check in the\n    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a buffer\n    over-read.  An attacker able to add USB devices could possibly use\n    this to cause a denial of service (crash).\nHui Peng and Mathias Payer reported unbounded recursion in the\n    usb-audio driver's descriptor parsing code, leading to a stack\n    overflow.  An attacker able to add USB devices could use this to\n    cause a denial of service (memory corruption or crash) or possibly\n    for privilege escalation.  On the amd64 architecture, and on the\n    arm64 architecture in buster, this is mitigated by a guard page\n    on the kernel stack, so that it is only possible to cause a crash.\nBrad Spengler reported that a backporting error reintroduced a\n    spectre-v1 vulnerability in the ptrace subsystem in the\n    ptrace_get_debugreg() function.\n"
