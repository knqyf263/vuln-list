    "Description": "A flaw was found in, ghostscript versions prior to 9.50, in the .pdf_hook_DSC_Creator procedure where it did not properly secure its privileged calls, enabling scripts to bypass `-dSAFER` restrictions. A specially crafted PostScript file could disable security protection and then have access to the file system, or execute arbitrary commands.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4518\nIt was discovered that various procedures in Ghostscript, the GPL\nPostScript/PDF interpreter, do not properly restrict privileged calls,\nwhich could result in bypass of file system restrictions of the dSAFER\nsandbox.\n"
