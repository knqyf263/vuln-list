      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-4581\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in git, a fast, scalable,\ndistributed revision control system.\nIt was reported that the --export-marks option of git fast-import is\n    exposed also via the in-stream command feature export-marks=...,\n    allowing to overwrite arbitrary paths.\nIt was discovered that submodule names are not validated strictly\n    enough, allowing very targeted attacks via remote code execution\n    when performing recursive clones.\nJoern Schneeweisz reported a vulnerability, where a recursive clone\n    followed by a submodule update could execute code contained within\n    the repository without the user explicitly having asked for that. It\n    is now disallowed for `.gitmodules` to have entries that set\n    `submodule.\u0026lt;name\u0026gt;.update=!command`.\nIn addition this update addresses a number of security issues which are\nonly an issue if git is operating on an NTFS filesystem (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1349\"\u003eCVE-2019-1349\u003c/a\u003e,\n\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1352\"\u003eCVE-2019-1352\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2019-1353\"\u003eCVE-2019-1353\u003c/a\u003e).\n"
