    "Description": "LibreOffice before 4.4.5 and Apache OpenOffice before 4.1.2 uses the stored LinkUpdateMode configuration information in OpenDocument Format files and templates when handling links, which might allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information via a crafted document, which embeds data from local files into (1) Calc or (2) Writer.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3394\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in LibreOffice, a\nfull-featured office productivity:\nFederico Scrinzi discovered an information leak in the handling of\n    ODF documents. Quoting from\n    \u003curl \"https://www.libreoffice.org/about-us/security/advisories/cve-2015-4551/\" /\u003e:\n    The LinkUpdateMode feature controls whether documents inserted into\n    Writer or Calc via links will either not get updated, or prompt to\n    update, or automatically update, when the parent document is loaded.\n    The configuration of this option was stored in the document. That\n    flawed approach enabled documents to be crafted with links to\n    plausible targets on the victims host computer. The contents of\n    those automatically inserted after load links can be concealed in\n    hidden sections and retrieved by the attacker if the document is\n    saved and returned to sender, or via http requests if the user has\n    selected lower security settings for that document.\nA buffer overflow in parsing the printer setup information in ODF\n    documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.\nA buffer overflow and an integer overflow in parsing\n    Microsoft Word documents may result in the execution of arbitrary code.\n"
