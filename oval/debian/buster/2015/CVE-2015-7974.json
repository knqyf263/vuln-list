    "Description": "NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p6 and 4.3.x before 4.3.90 do not verify peer associations of symmetric keys when authenticating packets, which might allow remote attackers to conduct impersonation attacks via an arbitrary trusted key, aka a \"skeleton key.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3629\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in the Network Time Protocol\ndaemon and utility programs:\nMatt Street discovered that insufficient key validation allows\n    impersonation attacks between authenticated peers.\nStephen Gray discovered that a NULL pointer dereference and a\n    buffer overflow in the handling of \u003cq\u003entpdc reslist\u003c/q\u003e commands may\n    result in denial of service.\nAanchal Malhotra discovered that if NTP is configured for broadcast\n    mode, an attacker can send malformed authentication packets which\n    break associations with the server for other broadcast clients.\nMatthew van Gundy and Jonathan Gardner discovered that missing\n    validation of origin timestamps in ntpd clients may result in denial\n    of service.\nJonathan Gardner discovered that missing input sanitising in ntpq\n    may result in denial of service.\nStephen Gray and Matthew van Gundy discovered that incorrect handling\n    of crypto NAK packets may result in denial of service.\nJonathan Gardner and Miroslav Lichvar discovered that ntpd clients\n    could be forced to change from basic client/server mode to interleaved\n    symmetric mode, preventing time synchronisation.\nMatthew van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered\n    that timing leaks in the packet authentication code could result\n    in recovery of a message digest.\nYihan Lian discovered that duplicate IPs on \u003cq\u003eunconfig\u003c/q\u003e directives will\n    trigger an assert.\nYihan Lian discovered that an OOB memory access could potentially\n    crash ntpd.\n"
