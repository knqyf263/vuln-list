    "Description": "The pit_ioport_read in i8254.c in the Linux kernel before 2.6.33 and QEMU before 2.3.1 does not distinguish between read lengths and write lengths, which might allow guest OS users to execute arbitrary code on the host OS by triggering use of an invalid index.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3348\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator.\nMatt Tait of Google's Project Zero security team discovered a flaw\n    in the QEMU i8254 PIT emulation. A privileged guest user in a guest\n    with QEMU PIT emulation enabled could potentially use this flaw to\n    execute arbitrary code on the host with the privileges of the\n    hosting QEMU process.\nKevin Wolf of Red Hat discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw in the\n    IDE subsystem in QEMU while processing certain ATAPI commands. A\n    privileged guest user in a guest with the CDROM drive enabled could\n    potentially use this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host with\n    the privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\nDonghai Zhu discovered that the QEMU model of the RTL8139 network\n    card did not sufficiently validate inputs in the C+ mode offload\n    emulation, allowing a malicious guest to read uninitialized memory\n    from the QEMU process's heap.\nMr Qinghao Tang from QIHU 360 Inc. and Mr Zuozhi from Alibaba Inc\n    discovered a buffer overflow flaw in the VNC display driver leading\n    to heap memory corruption. A privileged guest user could use this\n    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or\n    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\nA buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the way QEMU\n    handles the virtio-serial device. A malicious guest could use this\n    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n"
