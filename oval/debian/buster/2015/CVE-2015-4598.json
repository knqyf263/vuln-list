This could lead to a a crash or\n    execution of arbitrary code.\nA denial of service through a crash could be caused by a segfault\n    in the php_pgsql_meta_data function.\nkwrnel at hotmail dot com discovered that PHP could crash when\n    processing an invalid phar file, thus leading to a denial of\n    service.\njared at enhancesoft dot com discovered a buffer overflow in the\n    phar_fix_filepath function, that could causes a crash or execution\n    of arbitrary code.\nAdditionally, several other vulnerabilites were fixed:\nsean dot heelan at gmail dot com discovered a problem in the\n    unserialization of some items, that could lead to arbitrary code\n    execution.\nstewie at mail dot ru discovered that the phar extension improperly\n    handled zip archives with relative paths, which would allow an\n    attacker to overwrite files outside of the destination directory.\ntaoguangchen at icloud dot com discovered several use-after-free\n    vulnerabilities that could lead to arbitrary code execution.\n"
