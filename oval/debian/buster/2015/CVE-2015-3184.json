    "Description": "mod_authz_svn in Apache Subversion 1.7.x before 1.7.21 and 1.8.x before 1.8.14, when using Apache httpd 2.4.x, does not properly restrict anonymous access, which allows remote anonymous users to read hidden files via the path name.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3331\nSeveral security issues have been found in the server components of the\nversion control system subversion.\nSubversion's mod_authz_svn does not properly restrict anonymous\n    access in some mixed anonymous/authenticated environments when\n    using Apache httpd 2.4.  The result is that anonymous access may\n    be possible to files for which only authenticated access should\n    be possible. This issue does not affect the oldstable distribution\n    (wheezy) because it only contains Apache httpd 2.2.\nSubversion servers, both httpd and svnserve, will reveal some\n    paths that should be hidden by path-based authz.  When a node is\n    copied from an unreadable location to a readable location the\n    unreadable path may be revealed.  This vulnerablity only reveals\n    the path, it does not reveal the contents of the path.\n"
