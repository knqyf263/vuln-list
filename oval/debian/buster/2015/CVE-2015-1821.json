    "Description": "Heap-based buffer overflow in chrony before 1.31.1 allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (chronyd crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by configuring the (1) NTP or (2) cmdmon access with a subnet size that is indivisible by four and an address with a nonzero bit in the subnet remainder.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3222\nMiroslav Lichvar of Red Hat discovered multiple vulnerabilities in chrony,\nan alternative NTP client and server:\nUsing particular address/subnet pairs when configuring access control\n    would cause an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to\n    cause a denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.\nWhen allocating memory to save unacknowledged replies to authenticated\n    command requests, a pointer would be left uninitialized, which could\n    trigger an invalid memory write. This could allow attackers to cause a\n    denial of service (crash) or execute arbitrary code.\nWhen peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric\n    association, the internal state variables would be updated before the\n    MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote\n    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization\n    between NTP peers.\n"
