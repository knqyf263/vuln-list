    "Description": "io-tga.c in gdk-pixbuf before 2.32.0 uses heap memory after its allocation failed, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (heap-based buffer overflow and application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a crafted Truevision TGA (TARGA) file.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3378\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in gdk-pixbuf, a toolkit\nfor image loading and pixel buffer manipulation. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nGustavo Grieco discovered a heap overflow in the processing of TGA\n    images which may result in the execution of arbitrary code or denial\n    of service (process crash) if a malformed image is opened.\nGustavo Grieco discovered an integer overflow flaw in the processing\n    of GIF images which may result in the execution of arbitrary code or\n    denial of service (process crash) if a malformed image is opened.\n"
