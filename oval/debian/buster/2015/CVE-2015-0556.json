      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3213\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in arj, an open source\nversion of the arj archiver. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJakub Wilk discovered that arj follows symlinks created during\n    unpacking of an arj archive. A remote attacker could use this flaw\n    to perform a directory traversal attack if a user or automated\n    system were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.\nJakub Wilk discovered that arj does not sufficiently protect from\n    directory traversal while unpacking an arj archive containing file\n    paths with multiple leading slashes. A remote attacker could use\n    this flaw to write to arbitrary files if a user or automated system\n    were tricked into processing a specially crafted arj archive.\nJakub Wilk and Guillem Jover discovered a buffer overflow\n    vulnerability in arj. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause\n    an application crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the\n    privileges of the user running arj.\n"
