    "Description": "The symmetric-key feature in the receive function in ntp_proto.c in ntpd in NTP 4.x before 4.2.8p2 requires a correct MAC only if the MAC field has a nonzero length, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof packets by omitting the MAC.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3223\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in ntp, an implementation of the\nNetwork Time Protocol:\nWhen configured to use a symmetric key with an NTP peer, ntpd would\n    accept packets without MAC as if they had a valid MAC. This could\n    allow a remote attacker to bypass the packet authentication and send\n    malicious packets without having to know the symmetric key.\nWhen peering with other NTP hosts using authenticated symmetric\n    association, ntpd would update its internal state variables before\n    the MAC of the NTP messages was validated. This could allow a remote\n    attacker to cause a denial of service by impeding synchronization\n    between NTP peers.\nAdditionally, it was discovered that generating MD5 keys using ntp-keygen\non big endian machines would either trigger an endless loop, or generate\nnon-random keys.\n"
