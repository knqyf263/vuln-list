      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3361\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in qemu, a fast processor\nemulator.\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in\n    the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this\n    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a heap buffer overflow flaw\n    in the NE2000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this\n    flaw to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash), or\n    potentially to execute arbitrary code on the host with the\n    privileges of the hosting QEMU process.\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered an infinite loop issue in\n    the e1000 NIC emulation. A privileged guest user could use this flaw\n    to mount a denial of service (QEMU process crash).\nQinghao Tang of QIHU 360 Inc. discovered a flaw in the IDE\n    subsystem in QEMU occurring while executing IDE's\n    WIN_READ_NATIVE_MAX command to determine the maximum size of a\n    drive. A privileged guest user could use this flaw to mount a\n    denial of service (QEMU process crash).\n"
