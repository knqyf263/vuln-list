    "Description": "Django before 1.4.18, 1.6.x before 1.6.10, and 1.7.x before 1.7.3 allows remote attackers to spoof WSGI headers by using an _ (underscore) character instead of a - (dash) character in an HTTP header, as demonstrated by an X-Auth_User header.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3151\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python\nweb development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nJedediah Smith reported that the WSGI environ in Django does not\n    distinguish between headers containing dashes and headers containing\n    underscores. A remote attacker could use this flaw to spoof WSGI\n    headers.\nMikko Ohtamaa discovered that the django.util.http.is_safe_url()\n    function in Django does not properly handle leading whitespaces in\n    user-supplied redirect URLs. A remote attacker could potentially use\n    this flaw to perform a cross-site scripting attack.\nAlex Gaynor reported a flaw in the way Django handles reading files\n    in the django.views.static.serve() view. A remote attacker could\n    possibly use this flaw to mount a denial of service via resource\n    consumption.\n"
