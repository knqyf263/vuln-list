    "Description": "The prepend_path function in fs/dcache.c in the Linux kernel before 4.2.4 does not properly handle rename actions inside a bind mount, which allows local users to bypass an intended container protection mechanism by renaming a directory, related to a \"double-chroot attack.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3372\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, unauthorised\ninformation disclosure or unauthorised information modification.\nJann Horn discovered that when a subdirectory of a filesystem was\n    bind-mounted into a chroot or mount namespace, a user that should\n    be confined to that chroot or namespace could access the whole of\n    that filesystem if they had write permission on an ancestor of\n    the subdirectory.  This is not a common configuration for wheezy,\n    and the issue has previously been fixed for jessie.\nMoein Ghasemzadeh of Istuary Innovation Labs reported that a USB\n    device could cause a denial of service (crash) by imitating a\n    Whiteheat USB serial device but presenting a smaller number of\n    endpoints.\nMarcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered that creating multiple SCTP\n    sockets at the same time could cause a denial of service (crash)\n    if the sctp module had not previously been loaded.  This issue\n    only affects jessie.\nDmitry Vyukov discovered that System V IPC objects (message queues\n    and shared memory segments) were made accessible before their\n    ownership and other attributes were fully initialised.  If a local\n    user can race against another user or service creating a new IPC\n    object, this may result in unauthorised information disclosure,\n    unauthorised information modification, denial of service and/or\n    privilege escalation.\nA similar issue existed with System V semaphore arrays, but was\n    less severe because they were always cleared before being fully\n    initialised.\n"
