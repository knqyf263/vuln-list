    "Description": "strongSwan 4.3.0 through 5.x before 5.3.2 and strongSwan VPN Client before 1.4.6, when using EAP or pre-shared keys for authenticating an IKEv2 connection, does not enforce server authentication restrictions until the entire authentication process is complete, which allows remote servers to obtain credentials by using a valid certificate and then reading the responses.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3282\nAlexander E. Patrakov discovered an issue in strongSwan, an IKE/IPsec\nsuite used to establish IPsec protected links.\nWhen an IKEv2 client authenticates the server with certificates and the\nclient authenticates itself to the server using pre-shared key or EAP,\nthe constraints on the server certificate are only enforced by the\nclient after all authentication steps are completed successfully. A\nrogue server which can authenticate using a valid certificate issued by\nany CA trusted by the client could trick the user into continuing the\nauthentication, revealing the username and password digest (for EAP) or\neven the cleartext password (if EAP-GTC is accepted).\n"
