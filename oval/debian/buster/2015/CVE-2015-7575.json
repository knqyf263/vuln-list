    "Description": "Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) before 3.20.2, as used in Mozilla Firefox before 43.0.2 and Firefox ESR 38.x before 38.5.2, does not reject MD5 signatures in Server Key Exchange messages in TLS 1.2 Handshake Protocol traffic, which makes it easier for man-in-the-middle attackers to spoof servers by triggering a collision.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3491\nMultiple security issues have been found in Icedove, Debian's version of\nthe Mozilla Thunderbird mail client: Multiple memory safety errors,\ninteger overflows, buffer overflows and other implementation errors may\nlead to the execution of arbitrary code or denial of service.\nDSA-3457\nMultiple security issues have been found in Iceweasel, Debian's version\nof the Mozilla Firefox web browser: Multiple memory safety errors and a\nbuffer overflow may lead to the execution of arbitrary code. In addition\nthe bundled NSS crypto library addresses the SLOTH attack on TLS 1.2.\nDSA-3436\nKarthikeyan Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent at INRIA discovered a flaw in\nthe TLS 1.2 protocol which could allow the MD5 hash function to be used\nfor signing ServerKeyExchange and Client Authentication packets during a\nTLS handshake. A man-in-the-middle attacker could exploit this flaw to\nconduct collision attacks to impersonate a TLS server or an\nauthenticated TLS client.\nMore information can be found at\n\u003ca href='https://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH'\u003e\\\nhttps://www.mitls.org/pages/attacks/SLOTH\u003c/a\u003e\nDSA-3458\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in OpenJDK, an\nimplementation of the Oracle Java platform, resulting in breakouts of\nthe Java sandbox, information disclosur, denial of service and insecure\ncryptography.\n"
