    "Description": "arch/x86/kvm/x86.c in the Linux kernel before 4.4 does not reset the PIT counter values during state restoration, which allows guest OS users to cause a denial of service (divide-by-zero error and host OS crash) via a zero value, related to the kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit and kvm_vm_ioctl_set_pit2 functions.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3434\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleak.\nIt was discovered that a local user permitted to use the x86 KVM\n    subsystem could configure the PIT emulation to cause a denial of\n    service (crash).\nDmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the keyring subsystem\n    that allows a local user to cause a denial of service (crash).\nIt was discovered that a local user permitted to create raw sockets\n    could cause a denial-of-service by specifying an invalid protocol\n    number for the socket. The attacker must have the CAP_NET_RAW\n    capability.\nFelix Wilhelm of ERNW discovered that the Xen PV backend drivers\n    may read critical data from shared memory multiple times. This\n    flaw can be used by a guest kernel to cause a denial of service\n    (crash) on the host, or possibly for privilege escalation.\nKonrad Rzeszutek Wilk of Oracle discovered that the Xen PCI\n    backend driver does not adequately validate the device state when\n    a guest configures MSIs. This flaw can be used by a guest kernel\n    to cause a denial of service (crash or disk space exhaustion) on\n    the host.\nDmitry Vyukov discovered a flaw in the PPTP sockets implementation\n    that leads to an information leak to local users.\nDavid Miller discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth SCO sockets\n    implementation that leads to an information leak to local users.\nJann Horn discovered a flaw in the permission checks for use of\n    the ptrace feature. A local user who has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE\n    capability within their own user namespace could use this flaw for\n    privilege escalation if a more privileged process ever enters that\n    user namespace. This affects at least the LXC system.\nIn addition, this update fixes some regressions in the previous update:\nA regression in the UDP implementation prevented freeradius and\n    some other applications from receiving data.\nA regression in the USB XHCI driver prevented use of some devices\n    in USB 3 SuperSpeed ports.\nA fix to the radeon driver interacted with an existing bug to\n    cause a crash at boot when using some AMD/ATI graphics cards.\n    This issue only affects wheezy.\n"
