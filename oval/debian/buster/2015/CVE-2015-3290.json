    "Description": "arch/x86/entry/entry_64.S in the Linux kernel before 4.1.6 on the x86_64 platform improperly relies on espfix64 during nested NMI processing, which allows local users to gain privileges by triggering an NMI within a certain instruction window.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3313\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation or denial of service.\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly\n    handle nested NMIs. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw\n    for privilege escalation.\nAndy Lutomirski discovered that under certain conditions a malicious\n    userspace program can cause the kernel to skip NMIs leading to a\n    denial of service.\nCarl Henrik Lunde discovered that the UDF implementation is missing\n    a necessary length check. A local user that can mount devices could\n    use this flaw to crash the system.\nPetr Matousek and Andy Lutomirski discovered that an NMI that\n    interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is incorrectly\n    handled. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw for denial\n    of service or possibly for privilege escalation.\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to\n    cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid\n    checksums.\nIt was discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle\n    invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of\n    service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single\n    packet with an invalid checksum.\n"
