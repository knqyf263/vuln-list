    "Description": "The SMB1 implementation in smbd in Samba 3.x and 4.x before 4.1.23, 4.2.x before 4.2.9, 4.3.x before 4.3.6, and 4.4.x before 4.4.0rc4 allows remote authenticated users to modify arbitrary ACLs by using a UNIX SMB1 call to create a symlink, and then using a non-UNIX SMB1 call to write to the ACL content.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3514\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in Samba, a SMB/CIFS file,\nprint, and login server for Unix. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following issues:\nJeremy Allison of Google, Inc. and the Samba Team discovered that\n    Samba incorrectly handles getting and setting ACLs on a symlink\n    path. An authenticated malicious client can use SMB1 UNIX extensions\n    to create a symlink to a file or directory, and then use non-UNIX\n    SMB1 calls to overwrite the contents of the ACL on the file or\n    directory linked to.\nGarming Sam and Douglas Bagnall of Catalyst IT discovered that Samba\n    is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read issue during DNS TXT record\n    handling, if Samba is deployed as an AD DC and chosen to run the\n    internal DNS server. A remote attacker can exploit this flaw to\n    cause a denial of service (Samba crash), or potentially, to allow\n    leakage of memory from the server in the form of a DNS TXT reply.\nAdditionally this update includes a fix for a regression introduced due\nto the upstream fix for \u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2015-5252\"\u003eCVE-2015-5252\u003c/a\u003e in DSA-3433-1 in setups where the\nshare path is '/'.\n"
