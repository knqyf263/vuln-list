    "Description": "The build_index_from_tree function in index.py in Dulwich before 0.9.9 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a commit with a directory path starting with .git/, which is not properly handled when checking out a working tree.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3206\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Dulwich, a Python\nimplementation of the file formats and protocols used by the Git version\ncontrol system. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nIt was discovered that Dulwich allows writing to files under .git/\n    when checking out working trees. This could lead to the execution of\n    arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running an\n    application based on Dulwich.\nIvan Fratric of the Google Security Team has found a buffer\n    overflow in the C implementation of the apply_delta() function,\n    used when accessing Git objects in pack files. An attacker could\n    take advantage of this flaw to cause the execution of arbitrary\n    code with the privileges of the user running a Git server or client\n    based on Dulwich.\n"
