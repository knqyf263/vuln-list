    "Description": "The RAND_bytes function in libssh before 0.6.3, when forking is enabled, does not properly reset the state of the OpenSSL pseudo-random number generator (PRNG), which causes the state to be shared between children processes and allows local users to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a pid collision.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2879\nIt was discovered that libssh, a tiny C SSH library, did not reset the\nstate of the PRNG after accepting a connection. A server mode\napplication that forks itself to handle incoming connections could see\nits children sharing the same PRNG state, resulting in a cryptographic\nweakness and possibly the recovery of the private key.\n"
