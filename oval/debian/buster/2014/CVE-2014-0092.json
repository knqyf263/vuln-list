      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2869\nNikos Mavrogiannopoulos of Red Hat discovered an X.509 certificate\nverification issue in GnuTLS, an SSL/TLS library. A certificate\nvalidation could be reported sucessfully even in cases were an error\nwould prevent all verification steps to be performed.\nAn attacker doing a man-in-the-middle of a TLS connection could use this\nvulnerability to present a carefully crafted certificate that would be\naccepted by GnuTLS as valid even if not signed by one of the trusted\nauthorities.\n"
