    "Description": "cURL and libcurl before 7.38.0 does not properly handle IP addresses in cookie domain names, which allows remote attackers to set cookies for or send arbitrary cookies to certain sites, as demonstrated by a site at 192.168.0.1 setting cookies for a site at 127.168.0.1.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3022\nTwo vulnerabilities have been discovered in cURL, an URL transfer\nlibrary. They can be use to leak cookie information:\nBy not detecting and rejecting domain names for partial literal IP\n    addresses properly when parsing received HTTP cookies, libcurl can\n    be fooled to both sending cookies to wrong sites and into allowing\n    arbitrary sites to set cookies for others.\nlibcurl wrongly allows cookies to be set for Top Level Domains\n    (TLDs), thus making them apply broader than cookies are allowed.\n    This can allow arbitrary sites to set cookies that then would get\n    sent to a different and unrelated site or domain.\n"
