    "Description": "The email gateway in RT (aka Request Tracker) 3.0.0 through 4.x before 4.0.23 and 4.2.x before 4.2.10 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU and disk consumption) via a crafted email.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3176\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an\nextensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nChristian Loos discovered a remote denial of service vulnerability,\n    exploitable via the email gateway and affecting any installation\n    which accepts mail from untrusted sources. Depending on RT's\n    logging configuration, a remote attacker can take advantage of\n    this flaw to cause CPU and excessive disk usage.\nChristian Loos discovered an information disclosure flaw which may\n    reveal RSS feeds URLs, and thus ticket data.\nIt was discovered that RSS feed URLs can be leveraged to perform\n    session hijacking, allowing a user with the URL to log in as the\n    user that created the feed.\n"
