    "Description": "The django.core.urlresolvers.reverse function in Django before 1.4.11, 1.5.x before 1.5.6, 1.6.x before 1.6.3, and 1.7.x before 1.7 beta 2 allows remote attackers to import and execute arbitrary Python modules by leveraging a view that constructs URLs using user input and a \"dotted Python path.\"",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2934\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in Django, a high-level Python\nweb development framework. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures\nproject identifies the following problems:\nBenjamin Bach discovered that Django incorrectly handled dotted\n    Python paths when using the reverse() URL resolver function. An\n    attacker able to request a specially crafted view from a Django\n    application could use this issue to cause Django to import arbitrary\n    modules from the Python path, resulting in possible code execution.\nPaul McMillan discovered that Django incorrectly cached certain\n    pages that contained CSRF cookies. A remote attacker could use this\n    flaw to acquire the CSRF token of a different user and bypass\n    intended CSRF protections in a Django application.\nMichael Koziarski discovered that certain Django model field classes\n    did not properly perform type conversion on their arguments, which\n    allows remote attackers to obtain unexpected results.\nMichael Nelson, Natalia Bidart and James Westby discovered that\n    cached data in Django could be served to a different session, or to\n    a user with no session at all. An attacker may use this to retrieve\n    private data or poison caches.\nPeter Kuma and Gavin Wahl discovered that Django incorrectly\n    validated certain malformed URLs from user input. An attacker may\n    use this to cause unexpected redirects.\n"
