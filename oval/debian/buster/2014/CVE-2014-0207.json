    "Description": "The cdf_read_short_sector function in cdf.c in file before 5.19, as used in the Fileinfo component in PHP before 5.4.30 and 5.5.x before 5.5.14, allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (assertion failure and application exit) via a crafted CDF file.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2974\nSeveral vulnerabilities were found in PHP, a general-purpose scripting\nlanguage commonly used for web application development. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n    incorrect boundary check in the cdf_read_short_sector() function.\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered a\n    flaw in the way the truncated pascal string size in the mconvert()\n    function is computed.\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n    incorrect boundary check in the cdf_check_stream_offset() function.\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team reported an\n    insufficient boundary check in the cdf_count_chain() function.\nFrancisco Alonso of the Red Hat Security Response Team discovered an\n    incorrect boundary check in the cdf_read_property_info() funtion.\nStefan Esser discovered that the ArrayObject and the\n    SPLObjectStorage unserialize() handler do not verify the type of\n    unserialized data before using it. A remote attacker could use this\n    flaw to execute arbitrary code.\nStefan Esser discovered a type confusion issue affecting phpinfo(),\n    which might allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from\n    process memory.\nDSA-3021\nMultiple security issues have been found in file, a tool to determine \na file type. These vulnerabilities allow remote attackers to cause a \ndenial of service, via resource consumption or application crash.\n"
