    "Description": "The dbus-daemon in D-Bus 1.2.x through 1.4.x, 1.6.x before 1.6.20, and 1.8.x before 1.8.4, sends an AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the client is prohibited from accessing the service, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (initialization failure and exit) or possibly conduct a side-channel attack via a D-Bus message to an inactive service.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2971\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in dbus, an asynchronous\ninter-process communication system. The Common Vulnerabilities and\nExposures project identifies the following problems:\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered that dbus-daemon sends an\n    AccessDenied error to the service instead of a client when the\n    client is prohibited from accessing the service. A local attacker\n    could use this flaw to cause a bus-activated service that is not\n    currently running to attempt to start, and fail, denying other users\n    access to this service.\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. discovered a bug in dbus-daemon's\n    support for file descriptor passing. A malicious process could force\n    system services or user applications to be disconnected from the\n    D-Bus system by sending them a message containing a file descriptor,\n    leading to a denial of service.\nAlban Crequy at Collabora Ltd. and Alejandro MartĂ­nez SuĂĄrez\n    discovered that a malicious process could force services to be\n    disconnected from the D-Bus system by causing dbus-daemon to attempt\n    to forward invalid file descriptors to a victim process, leading to\n    a denial of service.\n"
