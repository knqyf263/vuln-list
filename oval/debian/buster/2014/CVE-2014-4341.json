    "Description": "MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) before 1.12.2 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (buffer over-read and application crash) by injecting invalid tokens into a GSSAPI application session.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3000\nSeveral vulnerabilities were discovered in krb5, the MIT implementation\nof Kerberos. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies\nthe following problems:\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject\n    packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session\n    can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when\n    attempting to read beyond the end of a buffer.\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to inject\n    packets into a legitimately established GSSAPI application session\n    can cause a program crash due to invalid memory references when\n    reading beyond the end of a buffer or by causing a null pointer\n    dereference.\nAn unauthenticated remote attacker with the ability to spoof packets\n    appearing to be from a GSSAPI acceptor can cause a double-free\n    condition in GSSAPI initiators (clients) which are using the SPNEGO\n    mechanism, by returning a different underlying mechanism than was\n    proposed by the initiator. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw\n    to cause an application crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.\nAn unauthenticated or partially authenticated remote attacker can\n    cause a NULL dereference and application crash during a SPNEGO\n    negotiation by sending an empty token as the second or later context\n    token from initiator to acceptor.\nWhen kadmind is configured to use LDAP for the KDC database, an\n    authenticated remote attacker can cause it to perform an\n    out-of-bounds write (buffer overflow).\n"
