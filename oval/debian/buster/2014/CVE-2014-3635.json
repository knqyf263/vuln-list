    "Description": "Off-by-one error in D-Bus 1.3.0 through 1.6.x before 1.6.24 and 1.8.x before 1.8.8, when running on a 64-bit system and the max_message_unix_fds limit is set to an odd number, allows local users to cause a denial of service (dbus-daemon crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code by sending one more file descriptor than the limit, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow or an assertion failure.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3026\nAlban Crequy and Simon McVittie discovered several vulnerabilities in\nthe D-Bus message daemon.\nOn 64-bit platforms, file descriptor passing could be abused by\n    local users to cause heap corruption in dbus-daemon,\n    leading to a crash, or potentially to arbitrary code execution.\nA denial-of-service vulnerability in dbus-daemon allowed local\n    attackers to prevent new connections to dbus-daemon, or disconnect\n    existing clients, by exhausting descriptor limits.\nMalicious local users could create D-Bus connections to\n    dbus-daemon which could not be terminated by killing the\n    participating processes, resulting in a denial-of-service\n    vulnerability.\ndbus-daemon suffered from a denial-of-service vulnerability in the\n    code which tracks which messages expect a reply, allowing local\n    attackers to reduce the performance of dbus-daemon.\ndbus-daemon did not properly reject malicious connections from\n    local users, resulting in a denial-of-service vulnerability.\n"
