An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input\ninto an application using libyaml could cause the application to crash.\nDSA-3115\nJonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the \nway wrapped strings are parsed in Python-YAML, a YAML parser and emitter \nfor Python. An attacker able to load specially crafted YAML input into an\napplication using python-yaml could cause the application to crash.\nDSA-3103\nJonathan Gray and Stanislaw Pitucha found an assertion failure in the\nway wrapped strings are parsed in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and\nemitter library.
