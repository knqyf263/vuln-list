    "Description": "Integer underflow in the MP4_ReadBox_String function in modules/demux/mp4/libmp4.c in VideoLAN VLC media player before 2.1.6 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service or possibly have unspecified other impact via a box size less than 7.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3150\nFabian Yamaguchi discovered multiple vulnerabilities in VLC, a multimedia\nplayer and streamer:\nThe MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check\n    the length of the box, leading to a possible integer underflow when\n    using this length value in a call to memcpy(). This could allow\n    remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary\n    code execution via crafted MP4 files.\nThe MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check\n    that the conversion of the box length from 64bit integer to 32bit\n    integer on 32bit platforms did not cause a truncation, leading to\n    a possible buffer overflow. This could allow remote attackers to\n    cause a denial of service (crash) or arbitrary code execution via\n    crafted MP4 files.\nThe MP4 demuxer, when parsing string boxes, did not properly check\n    the length of the box, leading to a possible buffer overflow. This\n    could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of service (crash)\n    or arbitrary code execution via crafted MP4 files.\nThe Dirac and Schroedinger encoders did not properly check for an\n    integer overflow on 32bit platforms, leading to a possible buffer\n    overflow. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial of\n    service (crash) or arbitrary code execution.\n"
