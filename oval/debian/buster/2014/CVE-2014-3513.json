    "Description": "Memory leak in d1_srtp.c in the DTLS SRTP extension in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1j allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a crafted handshake message.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3053\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been found in OpenSSL, the Secure Sockets\nLayer library and toolkit.\nA memory leak flaw was found in the way OpenSSL parsed the DTLS Secure\n    Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) extension data. A remote attacker\n    could send multiple specially crafted handshake messages to exhaust\n    all available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server.\nA flaw was found in the way SSL 3.0 handled padding bytes when\n    decrypting messages encrypted using block ciphers in cipher block\n    chaining (CBC) mode. This flaw allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM)\n    attacker to decrypt a selected byte of a cipher text in as few as 256\n    tries if they are able to force a victim application to repeatedly send\n    the same data over newly created SSL 3.0 connections. \nThis update adds support for Fallback SCSV to mitigate this issue.\nA memory leak flaw was found in the way an OpenSSL handled failed\n    session ticket integrity checks. A remote attacker could exhaust all\n    available memory of an SSL/TLS or DTLS server by sending a large number\n    of invalid session tickets to that server. \nWhen OpenSSL is configured with \"no-ssl3\" as a build option, servers\n    could accept and complete a SSL 3.0 handshake, and clients could be\n    configured to send them.\n"
