    "Description": "Libgcrypt before 1.6.3 and GnuPG before 1.4.19 does not implement ciphertext blinding for Elgamal decryption, which allows physically proximate attackers to obtain the server's private key by determining factors using crafted ciphertext and the fluctuations in the electromagnetic field during multiplication.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3184\nMultiple vulnerabilities were discovered in GnuPG, the GNU Privacy Guard:\nThe Elgamal decryption routine was susceptible to a side-channel\n    attack discovered by researchers of Tel Aviv University. Ciphertext\n    blinding was enabled to counteract it. Note that this may have a\n    quite noticeable impact on Elgamal decryption performance.\nThe modular exponentiation routine mpi_powm() was susceptible to a\n    side-channel attack caused by data-dependent timing variations when\n    accessing its internal pre-computed table.\nThe keyring parsing code did not properly reject certain packet\n    types not belonging in a keyring, which caused an access to memory\n    already freed. This could allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n    of service (crash) via crafted keyring files.\n"
