    "Description": "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the wptexturize function in WordPress before 3.7.5, 3.8.x before 3.8.5, and 3.9.x before 3.9.3 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via crafted use of shortcode brackets in a text field, as demonstrated by a comment or a post.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3085\nMultiple security issues have been discovered in Wordpress, a web\nblogging tool, resulting in denial of service or information disclosure.\nMore information can be found in the upstream advisory at\n\u003curl \"https://wordpress.org/news/2014/11/wordpress-4-0-1/\" /\u003e\nJouko Pynnonen discovered an unauthenticated cross site scripting\n    vulnerability (XSS) in wptexturize(), exploitable via comments or\n    posts.\nCross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the password\n    changing process, which could be used by an attacker to trick an\n    user into changing her password.\nJavier Nieto Arevalo and Andres Rojas Guerrero reported a potential\n    denial of service in the way the phpass library is used to handle\n    passwords, since no maximum password length was set.\nJohn Blackbourn reported an XSS in the \u003cq\u003ePress This\u003c/q\u003e function (used\n    for quick publishing using a browser \u003cq\u003ebookmarklet\u003c/q\u003e).\nRobert Chapin reported an XSS in the HTML filtering of CSS in posts.\nDavid Anderson reported a hash comparison vulnerability for\n    passwords stored using the old-style MD5 scheme. While unlikely,\n    this could be exploited to compromise an account, if the user had\n    not logged in after a Wordpress 2.5 update (uploaded to Debian on 2\n    Apr, 2008) and the password MD5 hash could be collided with due to\n    PHP dynamic comparison.\nBen Bidner reported a server side request forgery (SSRF) in the core\n    HTTP layer which unsufficiently blocked the loopback IP address\n    space.\nMomen Bassel, Tanoy Bose, and Bojan Slavkovic reported a\n    vulnerability in the password reset process: an email address change\n    would not invalidate a previous password reset email.\n"
