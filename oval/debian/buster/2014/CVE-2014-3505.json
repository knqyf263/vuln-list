    "Description": "Double free vulnerability in d1_both.c in the DTLS implementation in OpenSSL 0.9.8 before 0.9.8zb, 1.0.0 before 1.0.0n, and 1.0.1 before 1.0.1i allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted DTLS packets that trigger an error condition.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2998\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been identified in OpenSSL, a Secure\nSockets Layer toolkit, that may result in denial of service\n(application crash, large memory consumption), information leak,\nprotocol downgrade. Additionally, a buffer overrun affecting only\napplications explicitly set up for SRP has been fixed (\u003ca href=\"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2014-3512\"\u003eCVE-2014-3512\u003c/a\u003e).\nDetailed descriptions of the vulnerabilities can be found at:\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt\"\u003e\\\nwww.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140806.txt\u003c/a\u003e\nIt's important that you upgrade the libssl1.0.0 package and not just\nthe openssl package.\nAll applications linked to openssl need to be restarted. You can use\nthe \u003cq\u003echeckrestart\u003c/q\u003e tool from the debian-goodies package to detect\naffected programs. Alternatively, you may reboot your system.\n"
