    "Description": "The InfiniBand (IB) implementation in the Linux kernel package before 2.6.32-504.12.2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6 does not properly restrict use of User Verbs for registration of memory regions, which allows local users to access arbitrary physical memory locations, and consequently cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain privileges, by leveraging permissions on a uverbs device under /dev/infiniband/.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-3237\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that\nmay lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information\nleaks.\nIt was found that the Linux kernel's InfiniBand/RDMA subsystem did\n    not properly sanitize input parameters while registering memory\n    regions from user space via the (u)verbs API. A local user with\n    access to a /dev/infiniband/uverbsX device could use this flaw to\n    crash the system or, potentially, escalate their privileges on the\n    system.\nIt was found that the netfilter connection tracking subsystem used\n    too small a type as an offset within each connection's data\n    structure, following a bug fix in Linux 3.2.33 and 3.6.  In some\n    configurations, this would lead to memory corruption and crashes\n    (even without malicious traffic).  This could potentially also\n    result in violation of the netfilter policy or remote code\n    execution.\nThis can be mitigated by disabling connection tracking accounting:\u003cbr /\u003e\n    \u003ccode\u003esysctl net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct=0\u003c/code\u003e\nSasha Levin discovered that the LLC subsystem exposed some variables\n    as sysctls with the wrong type.  On a 64-bit kernel, this possibly\n    allows privilege escalation from a process with CAP_NET_ADMIN\n    capability; it also results in a trivial information leak.\nSasha Levin discovered that the RDS subsystem exposed some variables\n    as sysctls with the wrong type.  On a 64-bit kernel, this results in\n    a trivial information leak.\nJan Beulich discovered that Xen guests are currently permitted to\n    modify all of the (writable) bits in the PCI command register of\n    devices passed through to them.  This in particular allows them to\n    disable memory and I/O decoding on the device unless the device is\n    an SR-IOV virtual function, which can result in denial of service\n    to the host.\nAndrew Lutomirski discovered that when a 64-bit task on an amd64\n    kernel makes a fork(2) or clone(2) system call using int $0x80, the\n    32-bit compatibility flag is set (correctly) but is not cleared on\n    return.  As a result, both seccomp and audit will misinterpret the\n    following system call by the task(s), possibly leading to a\n    violation of security policy.\nModio AB discovered that the IPv6 subsystem would process a router\n    advertisement that specifies no route but only a hop limit, which\n    would then be applied to the interface that received it.  This can\n    result in loss of IPv6 connectivity beyond the local network.\nThis may be mitigated by disabling processing of IPv6 router\n    advertisements if they are not needed:\u003cbr /\u003e\n    \u003ccode\u003esysctl net.ipv6.conf.default.accept_ra=0\u003c/code\u003e\u003cbr /\u003e\n    \u003ccode\u003esysctl net.ipv6.conf.\u0026lt;interface\u0026gt;.accept_ra=0\u003c/code\u003e\nStephan Mueller discovered that the optimised implementation of\n    RFC4106 GCM for x86 processors that support AESNI miscalculated\n    buffer addresses in some cases.  If an IPsec tunnel is configured to\n    use this mode (also known as AES-GCM-ESP) this can lead to memory\n    corruption and crashes (even without malicious traffic).  This could\n    potentially also result in remote code execution.\nBen Hutchings discovered that the TCP Fast Open feature regressed\n    in Linux 3.16.7-ckt9, resulting in a kernel BUG when it is used.\n    This can be used as a local denial of service.\nIt was found that the execve(2) system call can race with inode\n    attribute changes made by chown(2).  Although chown(2) clears the\n    setuid/setgid bits of a file if it changes the respective owner ID,\n    this race condition could result in execve(2) setting effective\n    uid/gid to the new owner ID, a privilege escalation.\n"
