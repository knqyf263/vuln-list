    "Description": "The Intel drivers in Mesa 8.0.x and 9.0.x allow context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (reachable assertion and crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via vectors involving 3d graphics that trigger an out-of-bounds array access, related to the fs_visitor::remove_dead_constants function.  NOTE: this issue might be related to CVE-2013-0796.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2704\nIt was discovered that applications using the mesa library, a free\nimplementation of the OpenGL API, may crash or execute arbitrary code\ndue to an out of bounds memory access in the library.\nThis vulnerability only affects systems with Intel chipsets.\nThe oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.\n"
