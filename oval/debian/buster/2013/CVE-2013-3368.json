    "Description": "bin/rt in Request Tracker (RT) 3.8.x before 3.8.17 and 4.0.x before 4.0.13 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack on a temporary file with predictable name.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2670\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Request Tracker, an\nextensible trouble-ticket tracking system. The Common Vulnerabilities\nand Exposures project identifies the following problems:\nThe rt command line tool uses semi-predictable temporary files. A\n    malicious user can use this flaw to overwrite files with permissions\n    of the user running the rt command line tool.\nA malicious user who is allowed to see administration pages can run\n    arbitrary Mason components (without control of arguments), which may\n    have negative side-effects.\nRequest Tracker allows direct requests to private callback\n    components, which could be used to exploit a Request Tracker\n    extension or a local callback which uses the arguments passed to it\n    insecurely.\nRequest Tracker is vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks via\n    attachment filenames.\nDominic Hargreaves discovered that Request Tracker is vulnerable to\n    an HTTP header injection limited to the value of the\n    Content-Disposition header.\nRequest Tracker is vulnerable to a MIME header injection in outgoing\n    email generated by Request Tracker.\nRequest Tracker stock templates are resolved by this update. But any\n    custom email templates should be updated to ensure that values\n    interpolated into mail headers do not contain newlines.\nRequest Tracker is vulnerable to limited session re-use when using\n    the file-based session store, Apache::Session::File. However Request\n    Tracker's default session configuration only uses\n    Apache::Session::File when configured for Oracle databases.\nThis version of Request Tracker includes a database content upgrade. If\nyou are using a dbconfig-managed database, you will be offered the\nchoice of applying this automatically. Otherwise see the explanation in\n/usr/share/doc/request-tracker3.8/NEWS.Debian.gz for the manual steps to\nperform.\nPlease note that if you run request-tracker3.8 under the Apache web\nserver, you must stop and start Apache manually. The \u003cq\u003erestart\u003c/q\u003e mechanism\nis not recommended, especially when using mod_perl or any form of\npersistent Perl process such as FastCGI or SpeedyCGI.\n"
