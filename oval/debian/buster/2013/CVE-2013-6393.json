    "Description": "The yaml_parser_scan_tag_uri function in scanner.c in LibYAML before 0.1.5 performs an incorrect cast, which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (application crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via crafted tags in a YAML document, which triggers a heap-based buffer overflow.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2850\nFlorian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a\nheap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and\nemitter library. A remote attacker could provide a YAML document with a\nspecially-crafted tag that, when parsed by an application using libyaml,\nwould cause the application to crash or, potentially, execute arbitrary\ncode with the privileges of the user running the application.\nDSA-2870\nFlorian Weimer of the Red Hat Product Security Team discovered a\nheap-based buffer overflow flaw in LibYAML, a fast YAML 1.1 parser and\nemitter library.
