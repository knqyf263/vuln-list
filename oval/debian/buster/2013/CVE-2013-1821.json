      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2809\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for the\nRuby language. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project\nidentifies the following problems:\nBen Murphy discovered that unrestricted entity expansion in REXML\n    can lead to a Denial of Service by consuming all host memory.\nWilliam (B.J.) Snow Orvis discovered a vulnerability in the hostname\n    checking in Ruby's SSL client that could allow man-in-the-middle\n    attackers to spoof SSL servers via a crafted certificate issued by a\n    trusted certification authority.\nCharlie Somerville discovered that Ruby incorrectly handled floating\n    point number conversion. If an application using Ruby accepted\n    untrusted input strings and converted them to floating point\n    numbers, an attacker able to provide such input could cause the\n    application to crash or, possibly, execute arbitrary code with the\n    privileges of the application.\nDSA-2738\nSeveral vulnerabilities have been discovered in the interpreter for\nthe Ruby language, which may lead to denial of service and other\nsecurity problems.
