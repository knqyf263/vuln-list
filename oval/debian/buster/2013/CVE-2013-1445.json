    "Description": "The Crypto.Random.atfork function in PyCrypto before 2.6.1 does not properly reseed the pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) before allowing a child process to access it, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to obtain sensitive information by leveraging a race condition in which a child process is created and accesses the PRNG within the same rate-limit period as another process.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2781\nA cryptographic vulnerability was discovered in the pseudo random number\ngenerator in python-crypto.\nIn some situations, a race condition could prevent the reseeding of the\ngenerator when multiple processes are forked from the same parent. This would\nlead it to generate identical output on all processes, which might leak\nsensitive values like cryptographic keys.\n"
