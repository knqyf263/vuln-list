    "Description": "HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.17, and earlier module for Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first \".\" character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2801\nJonathan Dolle reported a design error in HTTP::Body, a Perl module for\nprocessing data from HTTP POST requests. The HTTP body multipart parser\ncreates temporary files which preserve the suffix of the uploaded file.\nAn attacker able to upload files to a service that uses\nHTTP::Body::Multipart could potentially execute commands on the server\nif these temporary filenames are used in subsequent commands without\nfurther checks.\nThis update restricts the possible suffixes used for the created\ntemporary files.\nThe oldstable distribution (squeeze) is not affected by this problem.\n"
