    "Description": "The TLS protocol 1.1 and 1.2 and the DTLS protocol 1.0 and 1.2, as used in OpenSSL, OpenJDK, PolarSSL, and other products, do not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a MAC check requirement during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for crafted packets, aka the \"Lucky Thirteen\" issue.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2622\nMultiple vulnerabilities have been found in PolarSSL. The Common\nVulnerabilities and Exposures project identifies the following issues:\nA timing side channel attack has been found in CBC padding\n    allowing an attacker to recover pieces of plaintext via statistical\n    analysis of crafted packages, known as the \u003cq\u003eLucky Thirteen\u003c/q\u003e issue.\nAn array index error might allow remote attackers to cause a denial\n    of service via vectors involving a crafted padding-length value\n    during validation of CBC padding in a TLS session.\nMalformed CBC data in a TLS session could allow remote attackers to\n    conduct distinguishing attacks via statistical analysis of timing\n    side-channel data for crafted packets.\n"
