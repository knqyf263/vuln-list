    "Description": "X.Org X server before 1.13.4 and 1.4.x before 1.14.1 does not properly restrict access to input events when adding a new hot-plug device, which might allow physically proximate attackers to obtain sensitive information, as demonstrated by reading passwords from a tty.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2661\nDavid Airlie and Peter Hutterer of Red Hat discovered that xorg-server,\nthe X.Org X server was vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw\nrelated to input handling and devices hotplug.\nWhen an X server is running but not on front (for example because of a VT\nswitch), a newly plugged input device would still be recognized and\nhandled by the X server, which would actually transmit input events to\nits clients on the background.\nThis could allow an attacker to recover some input events not intended\nfor the X clients, including sensitive information.\n"
