    "Description": "The is_safe_url function in utils/http.py in Django 1.4.x before 1.4.6, 1.5.x before 1.5.2, and 1.6 before beta 2 treats a URL's scheme as safe even if it is not HTTP or HTTPS, which might introduce cross-site scripting (XSS) or other vulnerabilities into Django applications that use this function, as demonstrated by \"the login view in django.contrib.auth.views\" and the javascript: scheme.",

      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2740\nNick Brunn reported a possible cross-site scripting vulnerability in\npython-django, a high-level Python web development framework.\nThe is_safe_url utility function used to validate that a used URL is on\nthe current host to avoid potentially dangerous redirects from\nmaliciously-constructed querystrings, worked as intended for HTTP and\nHTTPS URLs, but permitted redirects to other schemes, such as\njavascript:.\nThe is_safe_url function has been modified to properly recognize and\nreject URLs which specify a scheme other than HTTP or HTTPS, to prevent\ncross-site scripting attacks through redirecting to other schemes.\n"
