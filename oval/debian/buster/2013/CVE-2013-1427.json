    "Description": "The configuration file for the FastCGI PHP support for lighttpd before 1.4.28 on Debian GNU/Linux creates a socket file with a predictable name in /tmp, which allows local users to hijack the PHP control socket and perform unauthorized actions such as forcing the use of a different version of PHP via a symlink attack or a race condition.",
    "Debian": {
      "MoreInfo": "\nDSA-2649\nStefan BĂźhler discovered that the Debian specific configuration file for\nlighttpd webserver FastCGI PHP support used a fixed socket name in the\nworld-writable /tmp directory. A symlink attack or a race condition could be\nexploited by a malicious user on the same machine to take over the PHP control\nsocket and for example force the webserver to use a different PHP version.\nAs the fix is in a configuration file lying in /etc, the update won't be\nenforced if the file has been modified by the administrator. In that case, care\nshould be taken to manually apply the fix.\n"
