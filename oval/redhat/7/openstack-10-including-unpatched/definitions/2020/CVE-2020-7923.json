    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in mongodb. A user authorized to perform database queries may cause denial of service by issuing specially crafted queries, which violate an invariant in the query subsystem's support for geoNear. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite Capsule 6.5 ship MongoDB package however all other active streams of Satellite and Capsule do not ship those. Red Hat Satellite dropped MongoDB in order to unifying database backend, refer following blog for the decision - https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-satellite-standardize-postgresql-backend.\n\nRed Hat Update Infrastructure 3 ships an affected version of mongodb, however it does not use GeoQuery and it is not vulnerable to this flaw.",
