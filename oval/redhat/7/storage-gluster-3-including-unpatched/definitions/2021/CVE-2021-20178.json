    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in ansible. The 'authkey' and 'privkey' credentials are disclosed by default and not protected by no_log feature when using the snmp_facts module. Attackers could take advantage of this information to steal the SNMP credentials. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: The version of ansible shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage (RHGS) 3 includes the vulnerable snmp module. However, RHGS 3 no longer maintains its own version of Ansible, prerequisite is to enable ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of ansible which has many bug and security fixes.",
