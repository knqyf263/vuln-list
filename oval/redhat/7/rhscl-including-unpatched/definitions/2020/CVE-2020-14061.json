    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in jackson-databind 2.x in versions prior to 2.9.10.5. FasterXML jackson-databind 2.x mishandles the interaction between serialization gadgets and typing. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift Container Platform's elasticsearch plugins do ship the vulnerable component, it doesn't do any of the unsafe things described in https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3279231. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nRed Hat OpenStack Platform ships OpenDaylight, which contains the vulnerable jackson-databind. However, OpenDaylight does not expose jackson-databind in a way that would make it vulnerable, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for OpenDaylight. As such, Red Hat will not be providing a fix for OpenDaylight at this time.\n\nThe PKI module as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Satellite 6 does not enable polymorphic deserialization which is a required configuration for the vulnerability to be used, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product. We may update the jackson-databind dependency in a future release.\n\nThe version of jackson-databind as shipped in Red Hat Software Collections rh-maven35 is used only while building maven, thus it does not deserialize data coming from untrusted sources, lowering the impact of the vulnerability for the Product.\n            MITIGATION: The following conditions are needed for an exploit, we recommend avoiding all if possible:\n* Deserialization from sources you do not control\n* enableDefaultTyping()\n* @JsonTypeInfo using id.CLASS or id.MINIMAL_CLASS\n* oracle.jms.AQjms*ConnectionFactory in classpath",
