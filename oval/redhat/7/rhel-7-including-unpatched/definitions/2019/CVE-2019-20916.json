    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the pip package installer for Python when downloading or installing a remote package via a specified URL. More specifically, due to improper validation of the \"Content-Disposition\" HTTP response header a path traversal attack is possible leading to arbitrary file overwrite. An attacker who controls a malicious server could use this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on the system.\n            STATEMENT: This issue has been rated as having Moderate impact. Installing software from untrusted servers is strongly discouraged, as it may lead to system compromise regardless of this CVE.\n\nThis flaw did not affect the versions of `python-pip` in Python 3.8 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 and Red Hat Software Collections 3, as they already included the fix for this CVE.\n            MITIGATION: Avoid downloading or installing packages from potentially malicious servers via the command-line \"pip download\" or \"pip install\".",
