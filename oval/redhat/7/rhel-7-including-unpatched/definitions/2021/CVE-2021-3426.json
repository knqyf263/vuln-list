    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: There's a flaw in Python 3's pydoc. A local or adjacent attacker who discovers or is able to convince another local or adjacent user to start a pydoc server could access the server and use it to disclose sensitive information belonging to the other user that they would not normally be able to access. The highest risk of this flaw is to data confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Quay from version 3.4 uses Python from Red Hat Enterprise Linux RPM repositories and therefore may receive an update for this issue in a future release. Earlier versions of Red Hat Quay will not receive an patch for this issue.\n\nPython 2.x.x as shipped in any Red Hat product is not affected. This flaw is out of support scope for python3 as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. For more information about Red Hat Enterprise Linux support scope, please see https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/ .\n            MITIGATION: Use the console (no argument needed) or HTML file (-w argument) output to generate docs rather than the HTTP server options.",
