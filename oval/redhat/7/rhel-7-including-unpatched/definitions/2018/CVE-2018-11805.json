    "Description": "STATEMENT: The attack is triggered by malicious specially crafted .cf files which are basically configuration files for spamassasin. These files can be located at:\n1. /usr/share/spamassassin\n2. /etc/mail/spamassassin\n3. user's home directory, in a directory called .spamassassin\n\nAll of these locations can only be accessed by either the system administrator or by a user having a local shell account on the machine. In order to successfully exploit this flaw, the attacker needs to convince the user to place the malicious configuration files in one of the above locations.\n            MITIGATION: The attack is triggered by malicious specially crafted .cf files which are configuration files for spamassasin. Do not use untrusted configuration files for spamassisin",
