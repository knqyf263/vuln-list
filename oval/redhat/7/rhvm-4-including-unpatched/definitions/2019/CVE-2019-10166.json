    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that libvirtd would permit readonly clients to use the virDomainManagedSaveDefineXML() API, which would permit them to modify managed save state files. If a managed save had already been created by a privileged user, a local attacker could modify this file such that libvirtd would execute an arbitrary program when the domain was resumed.\n            STATEMENT: * This vulnerability requires access to the libvirt socket, normally in /var/run/libvirt/libvirt_sock_ro.  Typically in hypervisor environments, local user accounts are not supported so no untrusted users should be able to access this socket.\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 is not affected by this vulnerability as libvirtd daemon is not shipped in Gluster.\n            MITIGATION: The Unix permissions of libvirt's read-only socket can be made more restrictive than the default (0777) by editing `/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf`.  The settings `unix_sock_group = libvirt` and `unix_sock_ro_perms = 0770` will restrict access to only members of `libvirt`, who already have management access to virtual machines.",
