    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the Linux kernel's seq_file in the Filesystem layer. This flaw allows a local attacker with a user privilege to gain access to out-of-bound memory, leading to a system crash or a leak of internal kernel information. The issue results from not validating the size_t-to-int conversion prior to performing operations. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity, confidentiality and system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Any Red Hat product which relies on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel is also potentially impacted. \nThis includes layered products such as OpenShift Container Platform, OpenStack, Red Hat Virtualization, and others.\n            MITIGATION: Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
