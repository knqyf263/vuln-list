    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Ansible Engine's ansible-connection module. Sensitive information like the Ansible user credentials are disclosed by default in the traceback error message. The highest threat out of this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of ansible, prerequisite is to enable ansible repository in order to consume the latest version of ansible which has many bug and security fixes.\n\nRed Hat Ceph Storage 2 only provides fixes for bugs on an as requested basis by a customer, and will not be fixed after discussion with engineering about the viability of a fix. Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 does not directly ship ansible, and thus is closed as won't fix.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization ships an affected version of ansible, however usage of ansible on the redhat-virtualization-host is only supported for self-hosted-engine installation and disaster recovery, where it is run locally. As such Impact is rated Moderate.",
