    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Linux kernelâ€™s handling of the removal of Bluetooth HCI controllers. This flaw allows an attacker with a local account to exploit a race condition, leading to corrupted memory and possible privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n            \n            MITIGATION: To mitigate these vulnerabilities on the operating system level, disable the Bluetooth functionality via blocklisting kernel modules in the Linux kernel. The kernel modules can be prevented from being loaded by using system-wide modprobe rules. Instructions on how to disable Bluetooth modules are available on the Customer Portal at https://access.redhat.com/solutions/2682931.\n\nAlternatively, Bluetooth can be disabled within the hardware or at the BIOS level which will also provide effective mitigation as the kernel will not be able to detect that Bluetooth hardware is present on the system.",
