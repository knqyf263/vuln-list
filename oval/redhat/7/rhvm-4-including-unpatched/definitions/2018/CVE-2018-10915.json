    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A vulnerability was found in libpq, the default PostgreSQL client library where libpq failed to properly reset its internal state between connections. If an affected version of libpq were used with \"host\" or \"hostaddr\" connection parameters from untrusted input, attackers could bypass client-side connection security features, obtain access to higher privileged connections or potentially cause other impact through SQL injection, by causing the PQescape() functions to malfunction.\n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability is only exploitable where an attacker can provide or influence connection parameters to a PostgreSQL client application using libpq. Contrib modules \"dblink\" and \"postgres_fdw\" are examples of applications affected by this flaw.\n\nRed Hat Virtualization includes vulnerable versions of postgresql. However this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported configuration of Red Hat Virtualization. A future update may address this issue.\n\nThis issue affects the versions of the rh-postgresql95-postgresql package as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 5.7 and 5.8. However, this flaw is not known to be exploitable under any supported scenario in Satellite 5. A future update may address this issue.",
