    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that ansible.cfg is being read from the current working directory, which can be made to point to plugin or module paths that are under control of the attacker. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 ships the affected version of ansible, but they no longer maintain their own version of ansible. Both the products will consume fixes directly from ansible repository.",
