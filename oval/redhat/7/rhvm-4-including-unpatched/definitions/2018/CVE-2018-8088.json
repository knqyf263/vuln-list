    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An XML deserialization vulnerability was discovered in slf4j's EventData, which accepts an XML serialized string and can lead to arbitrary code execution.\n            STATEMENT: Subscription Asset Manager is now in a reduced support phase receiving only Critical impact security fixes. This issue has been rated as having a security impact of Important, and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of Candlepin as shipped with Red Hat Satellite 6 as Candlepin uses slf4j-api and not the affected slf4j-ext (which is not on the Candlepin classpath).\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 4.1 is affected by this issue. Updated packages that address this issue are available through the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server channels. Virtualization Manager hosts should be subscribed to these channels and obtain the updates via `yum update`.",
