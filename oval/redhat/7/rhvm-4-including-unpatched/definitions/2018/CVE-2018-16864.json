    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An allocation of memory without limits, that could result in the stack clashing with another memory region, was discovered in systemd-journald when a program with long command line arguments calls syslog. A local attacker may use this flaw to crash systemd-journald or escalate privileges.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of systemd as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having a security impact of Important because it allows a local attacker to crash systemd-journald or escalate his privileges. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n            MITIGATION: To increase the time an attacker needs to exploit this flaw you could override the `StartLimitInterval=` (called StartLimitIntervalSec in newer systemd versions) and `StartLimitBurst=` settings. In this way the attack may require much longer to be successful.\n\nTo edit the journald service use `sudo systemctl edit systemd-journald.service` and add:\n```\n[Service]\nStartLimitInterval=120\nStartLimitBurst=3\n```",
