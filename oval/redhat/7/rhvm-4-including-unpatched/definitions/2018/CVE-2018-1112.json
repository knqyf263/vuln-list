    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that fix for CVE-2018-1088 introduced a new vulnerability in the way 'auth.allow' is implemented in glusterfs server. An unauthenticated gluster client could mount gluster storage volumes.\n            STATEMENT: This vulnerability affects gluster servers that use 'auth.allow' to restrict access to gluster volumes. Gluster servers using TLS to authenticate gluster clients are not affected by this. This vulnerability allows any client to connect to any gluster volume which only uses auth.allow to restrict access.\n\nThis issue did not affect the versions of glusterfs as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 because only gluster client is shipped in these products. CVE-2018-1112 affects glusterfs-server package as shipped with Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.\n            MITIGATION: 1. Use TLS Authentication to authenticate gluster clients to limit access to gluster storage volumes\n\n2. The gluster server should be on LAN, firewalled to trusted systems, and not reachable from public networks.",
