    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in ansible-collection where credentials such as secrets are being disclosed in console log by default and not protected by secured feature when using bitbucket_pipeline_variable module. An attacker can take advantage of this information to steal bitbucket_pipeline credentials.\n            STATEMENT: The version of ansible provided in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 does not contain the vulnerable bitbucket module and is not affected by this vulnerability. However, Red Hat Gluster Storage 3 no longer maintains its own version of Ansible, prerequisite is to enable ansible repository in order to consume latest version of ansible which has many bug and security fixes.",
