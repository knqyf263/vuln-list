    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was discovered that net/http (through net/textproto) in golang does not correctly interpret HTTP requests where an HTTP header contains spaces before the colon. This could be abused by an attacker to smuggle HTTP requests when a proxy or a firewall is placed behind a server implemented in Go or to filter bypasses depending on the specific network configuration.\n            STATEMENT: * This issue affects the versions of golang as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, however it was deprecated in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 and it does not receive updates anymore. Developers are encouraged to use the Go Toolset instead, which is available through the Red Hat Developer program. See https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/7.6_release_notes/chap-red_hat_enterprise_linux-7.6_release_notes-other_deprecated_functionality#idm140555585405248.\n* The version of golang provided in Red Hat Gluster Storage 3, Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 and Red Hat Ceph Storage 3 allows filter bypasses or request smuggling and contains the vulnerable code hence affected by this vulnerability.\n* In OpenShift Container Platform, all packages and container images built with a vulnerable version of Go and use the net/http package are affected by this flaw.",
