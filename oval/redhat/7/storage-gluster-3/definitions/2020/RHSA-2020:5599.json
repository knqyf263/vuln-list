    "Description": "Red Hat Gluster Storage is software only scale-out storage solution that\nprovides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data\nstorage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves\navailability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.\n\nSecurity Fix(es):\n\n* grafana: SSRF incorrect access control vulnerability allows unauthenticated users to make grafana send HTTP requests to any URL (CVE-2020-13379)\n\nFor more details about the security issue(s), including the impact, a CVSS score, acknowledgments, and other related information, refer to the CVE page(s) listed in the References section.\n\nThis advisory fixes the following bug:\n\n* Previously, tendrl-node-agent service was unable to import the cluster in a VMware environment as tendrl was looking for the serial number of the devices. With the current update, tendrl-node-agent service is able to import the cluster in a VMware environment without failure as the hardware_id and parent_id of the devices are used after proper validation instead of the serial number. (BZ#1809920)\n\nUsers of web-admin-build with Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.",
