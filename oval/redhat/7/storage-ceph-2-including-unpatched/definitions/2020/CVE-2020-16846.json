    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in salt. A shell injection vulnerability was found where an unauthenticated user with network access to the Salt API can use shell injections to run code on the Salt-API using the SSH client. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, information disclosure, or privilege escalation. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 shipped salt for the usage of Red Hat Storage Console 2 (RHSCON-2), which required salt to administrate ceph nodes. RHSCON-2 has reached End Of Life, hence salt is no longer used and supported. Therefore, the salt package provided by Red Hat Ceph Storage 2 has been marked as 'will not fix'.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
