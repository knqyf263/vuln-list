    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in Jolokia, versions 1.2 through 1.6.0, where Jolokia did not correctly handle checking for origin and referrer headers when strict checking was enabled. An attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct cross-site request forgery or further attacks.\n            STATEMENT: In Red Hat OpenStack Platform, jolokia is not enabled by default and, when enabled, the jolokia endpoints do not rely on CORS for security. Therefore, the impact has been reduced to Low and no updates will be provided at this time for the RHOSP jolokia package.",
