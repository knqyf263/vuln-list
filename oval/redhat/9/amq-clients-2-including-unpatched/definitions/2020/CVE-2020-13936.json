    "Description": "STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) openshift-logging/elasticsearch6-rhel8 container does contain a vulnerable version of velocity, however the references to the library only occur in the x-pack component which is an enterprise only feature of Elasticsearch - hence it has been marked as wontfix as this time and may be fixed in a future release. Additionally the hive-container only references velocity in the testutils of the code but the code still exists in the container, hence it has been given a Moderate impact.\n\nvelocity as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 is not affected because it does not contain the vulnerable code.\nAlthough velocity shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8's pki-deps for IdM/ipa is a vulnerable version, the vulnerable code is not used by pki.",
