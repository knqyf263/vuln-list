    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack.\n            STATEMENT: This is a a null pointer dereference in the X509_issuer_and_serial_hash()  function, which can result in crash if called by an application compiled with OpenSSL, by passing a specially-crafted certificate. OpenSSL internally does not use this function.\n            MITIGATION: As per upstream \"The function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained from untrusted sources.\"",
