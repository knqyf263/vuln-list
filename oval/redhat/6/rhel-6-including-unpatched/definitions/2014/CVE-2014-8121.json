    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that the files back end of Name Service Switch (NSS) did not isolate iteration over an entire database from key-based look-up API calls. An application performing look-ups on a database while iterating over it could enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affects the versions of glibc as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Red Hat Product Security has rated this issue as having Low security impact. A future update may address this issue. For additional information, refer to the Issue Severity Classification: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification/.\n\nRed Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is now in Production 3 Phase of the support and maintenance life cycle. This issue has been rated as having Low security impact and is not currently planned to be addressed in future updates.
