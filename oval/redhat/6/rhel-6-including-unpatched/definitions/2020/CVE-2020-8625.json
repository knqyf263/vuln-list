    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A buffer overflow flaw was found in the SPNEGO implementation used by BIND. This flaw allows a remote attacker to cause the named process to crash or possibly perform remote code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: BIND servers shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux are compiled with GSS-TSIG and are therefore affected by this flaw. However, these BIND packages use the default settings and are not vulnerable by default.\n            MITIGATION: As per upstream:\n\nBIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG features.\n\nIn a configuration which uses BIND's default settings, the vulnerable code path is NOT exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconfiguration options.\n\nAlthough the default configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.\n\nThis vulnerability only affects servers configured to use GSS-TSIG,  most often to sign dynamic updates. If another mechanism can be  used to authenticate updates, the vulnerability can be avoided by choosing not to enable the use of GSS-TSIG features.",
