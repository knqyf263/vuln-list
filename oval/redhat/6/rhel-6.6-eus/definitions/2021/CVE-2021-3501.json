    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. The value of internal.ndata, in the KVM API, is mapped to an array index, which can be updated by a user process at anytime which could lead to an out-of-bounds write. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity and system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue affected Linux kernel versions as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 starting with RHEL-8.4.0 and onward kernel version.\n            MITIGATION: Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options don't meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base or stability.",
