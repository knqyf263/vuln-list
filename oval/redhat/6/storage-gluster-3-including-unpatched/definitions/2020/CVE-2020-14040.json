    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A denial of service vulnerability was found in the golang.org/x/text library. A library or application must use one of the vulnerable functions, such as unicode.Transform, transform.String, or transform.Byte, to be susceptible to this vulnerability. If an attacker is able to supply specific characters or strings to the vulnerable application, there is the potential to cause an infinite loop to occur using more memory, resulting in a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) 1.0 is Out Of Support Scope (OOSS) for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities. Jaeger was packaged with ServiceMesh in 1.0, and hence is also marked OOSS, but the Jaeger-Operator is a standalone product and is affected by this vulnerability.",
