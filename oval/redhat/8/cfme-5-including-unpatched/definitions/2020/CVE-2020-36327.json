    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in rubygem-bundler. Bundler sometimes chooses a dependency source based on the highest gem version number, which means that a rogue gem found at a public source may be chosen, even if the intended choice was a private gem that is a dependency of another private gem that is explicitly depended on by the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Satellite does not ship RubyGem bundler, however, the product consumes it from the Red Hat Software Collections (RHSCL) repository.",
