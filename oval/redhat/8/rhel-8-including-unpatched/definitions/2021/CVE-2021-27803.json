    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the wpa_supplicant, in the way it processes P2P (Wi-Fi Direct) provision discovery requests. This flaw allows an attacker who is within radio range of the device running P2P discovery to cause termination of the wpa_supplicant process or potentially cause code execution. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: An attacker (or a system controlled by the attacker) needs to be within radio range of the vulnerable system to send a set of suitably constructed management frames that trigger the corner case to be reached in the management of the P2P peer table.\n            MITIGATION: Disable the P2P (control interface command \"P2P_SET disabled 1\" or \"p2p_disabled=1\" in (each, if multiple interfaces used) wpa_supplicant configuration file)",
