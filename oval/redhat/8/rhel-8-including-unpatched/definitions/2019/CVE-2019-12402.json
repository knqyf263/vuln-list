    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A resource consumption vulnerability was discovered in apache-commons-compress in the way NioZipEncoding encodes filenames. Applications that use Compress to create archives, with one of the filenames within the archive being controlled by the user, may be vulnerable to this flaw. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause an infinite loop during the archive creation, thus leading to a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect the versions of apache-commons-compress as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, and the versions of rh-java-common-apache-commons-compress and rh-maven35-apache-commons-compress as shipped with Red Hat Software Collections 3, as they used a fallback zip encoding implementation (leveraging java.io) to encode filenames.\nThis issue does not affect the versions of rh-maven36-apache-commons-compress as shipped with Red Hat Software Collection 3 as they already include the patch.",
