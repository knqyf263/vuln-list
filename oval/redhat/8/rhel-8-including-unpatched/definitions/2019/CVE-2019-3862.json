    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out of bounds read flaw was discovered in libssh2 in the way SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST packets with an exit status message and no payload are parsed. A remote attacker who compromises a SSH server may be able to cause a denial of service or read data in the client memory.\n            STATEMENT: This flaw was present in libssh2 packages included in Red Hat Virtualization Hypervisor and Management Appliance, however libssh2 in these hosts is never exposed to malicious clients or servers.\n\nlibssh2 is no longer included in the virt module since Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.1.",
