    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: An out-of-bounds read flaw was found in python-pillow in the way JP2 images are parsed. An application that uses python-pillow to decode untrusted images may be vulnerable to this issue. This flaw allows an attacker to read data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to confidentiality.\n            STATEMENT: This issue did not affect the versions of python-pillow and python-imaging as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7 as they did not include the JP2 image parser, where the flaw lies.",
