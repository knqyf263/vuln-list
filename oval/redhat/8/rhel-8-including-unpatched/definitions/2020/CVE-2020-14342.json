    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: It was found that cifs-utils' mount.cifs was invoking a shell when requesting the Samba password, which could be used to inject arbitrary commands. An attacker able to invoke mount.cifs with special permission, such as via sudo rules, could use this flaw to escalate their privileges.\n            STATEMENT: In order to exploit this flaw, the attacker would need to be able to inject a specially crafted username into the command run by root. This requires a specific setup (e.g.: sudo rules, etc.).\nAs a result, the vulnerability is considered as low severity.",
