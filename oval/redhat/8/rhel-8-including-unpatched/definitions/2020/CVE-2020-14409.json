    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in SDL2. An attacker who is able to submit a crafted file to an application depending on SDL2's functionality could trigger an integer overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds write. The highest impact is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.\n            STATEMENT: SDL as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6, 7, and 8 is not affected as the vulnerable code exists in SDL2; SDL is already hardened for this flaw.",
