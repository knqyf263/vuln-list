    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was discovered in the Apache Kafka protocol dissector of Wireshark while decoding packets captured in a pcap file or coming from the network. A remote attacker may abuse this flaw by sending specially crafted packets that, when processed, would potentially make Wireshark crash resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: This issue does not affect the versions of `wireshark` as shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6, and 7, as they did not include support for the Apache Kafka dissector.",
