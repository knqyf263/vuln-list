    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat Product Security has rated the severity of this flaw as Moderate because although the Confidentiality impact is high, the attack complexity is also high as a particular attacker would at least need to coordinate social engineering a victim to connect to a bad server, and also perform a man-in-the-middle attack or perform similar interception of the connection. Please see the following page for details on Red Hat severity ratings with special attention to Moderate: https://access.redhat.com/security/updates/classification .",
