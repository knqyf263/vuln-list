    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: The package python/cpython is vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.\n            STATEMENT: Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 3 ships an older version of python-django without the directly affected function, but which is still vulnerable to a similar attack involving the semi colon separator. Hence, impact has been rated as low.\nAlthough Red Hat OpenStack Platform 13 \u0026 16.1 both ship the affected code, since the proxy is controlled and configured by OpenStack, the impact has been lowered to low. As a fix would require a substantial effort or commitment of time, no fix will be provided at this time.",
