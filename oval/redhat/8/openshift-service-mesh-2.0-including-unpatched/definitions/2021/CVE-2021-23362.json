    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A regular expression denial of service vulnerability was found in hosted-git-info. If an application allows user input into the affected regular expression (regexp) function, `shortcutMatch` or `fromUrl`, then an attacker could craft a regexp which takes an ever increasing amount of time to process, potentially resulting in a denial of service.\n            STATEMENT: While some components do package a vulnerable version of hosted-git-info, access to them requires OpenShift OAuth credentials and hence have been marked with a Low impact. This applies to the following products:\n  - OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)\n  - OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM)\n\nSpecifically the following components:\n - The OCP hive-container does ship the vulnerable component, however since OCP 4.6 the Metering product has been deprecated [1], set as wont-fix and may be fixed in a future release.\n - In OCP and OSSM, the grafana components, whist they do have the hosted-git-info dependency it does not get included in the final build, webpack does not include it, hence it has been set to not affected. \n\n[1] - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/5707561",
