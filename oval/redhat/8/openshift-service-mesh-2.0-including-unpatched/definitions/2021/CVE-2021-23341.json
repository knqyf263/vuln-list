    "Description": "STATEMENT: OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)  and Red Hat Ceph Storage (RHCS) 3 and 4  grafana-container does package a vulnerable verison of prismjs. However due to the instance being read only and behind OpenShift OAuth, it has been given a Low impact. Additionally it has been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.\n\nOpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM)  and RHCS 3 and 4 grafana rpm (servicemesh-grafana) includes a vulnerable version of prismjs. Due to the component being behind OpenShift OAuth and the vulnerability itself being limited to the syntax highlighting within grafana, it has been given a Low impact. The OSSM  and RHCS 3 and 4 servicemesh-grafana component has been marked as wont-fix at this time and may be fixed in a future release.",
