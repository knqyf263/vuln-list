    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in ssri package. A malicious string provided by an attacker may lead to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS). This issue only affects consumers\nusing the strict option. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to availability.\n            STATEMENT: Whilst the OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) servicemesh-grafana and servicemesh-prometheus include  the vulnerable ssri library, the vulnerable \"strict\" option is not used. Similar to OSSM, OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) or Red Hat Advance Cluster Management for Kubernetes (RHACM) components include the vulnerable ssri library but the \"strict\" option is not used. Additionally access to the vulnerable library is protected by OpenShift OAuth what reducing impact by this flaw to LOW. Therefore these OSSM, OCP and RHACM components have been marked as wont-fix and may be addressed in a future updates.",
