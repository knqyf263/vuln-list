    "Description": "STATEMENT: Whilst the OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) and OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) containers include  the vulnerable nodejs-node-notifier library, the successful exploitation requires additional packages on the node (like desktop notification library) which are not part of the OpenShift ServiceMesh or OpenShift Container Platform products. Additionally access to the vulnerable nodejs-node-notifier library is restricted to authenticated users only (OpenShift OAuth authentication). Therefore these OSSM and OCP components have been marked as wont-fix and may be addressed in a future updates.\nOpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) 1.1 is out of support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities, hence is marked Out Of Support Scope.\n\nThe nodejs-notifier library was present in Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes version 2.0, but is no longer used since version 2.1. Customers are advised to upgrade to the latest version which is fully supported, does not include this vulnerability.",
