  "PackageSlug": "gem/activerecord",
  "Title": "SQL Injection Vulnerabilities Affecting PostgreSQL",
  "Description": "PostgreSQL adapter only. A bug in the SQL quoting code in ActiveRecord can allow an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL using carefully crafted values. Only applications which query against either bitstring or range types are vulnerable. Depending on the version of Rails you're using, the vulnerable code will take either take the form of: ``` Model.where(bitstring: params[:some_value]) Model.where(range: params[:from]..params[:to]) ``` The only feasible workaround for this issue is to not allow user controlled values to be used in queries with the affected data types. Upgrading is strongly advised.",
