  "Identifier": "CVE-2013-1856",
  "PackageSlug": "gem/activesupport",
  "Title": "XML Parsing Vulnerability affecting JRuby users",
  "Description": "There is a vulnerability in the JDOM backend to ActiveSupport's XML parser. This could allow an attacker to perform a denial of service attack or gain access to files stored on the application server. The ActiveSupport XML parsing functionality supports multiple pluggable backends. One backend supported for JRuby users is `ActiveSupport::XmlMini_JDOM` which makes use of the `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilder` class. In some JVM configurations the default settings of that class can allow an attacker to construct XML which, when parsed, will contain the contents of arbitrary URLs including files from the application server. They may also allow for various denial of service attacks. If you are using JRuby and have an affected JVM, you should upgrade or use one of the work arounds immediately.",
