  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-15257",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/containerd/containerd",
  "Title": "Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres",
  "Description": "The containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host network containers. Access controls for the shimâ€™s API socket verified that the connecting process had an effective `UID` of `0`, but did not otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace as the shim, with an effective `UID` of `0` but otherwise reduced privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges.",
