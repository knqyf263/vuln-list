  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-8918",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/google/go-tpm",
  "Title": "Improper Initialization",
  "Description": "An improperly initialized `migrationAuth' value in Google's go-tpm library can lead an eavesdropping attacker to discover the `auth` value for a key created with CreateWrapKey. An attacker listening in on the channel can collect both `encUsageAuth` and `encMigrationAuth`, and then can calculate `usageAuth ^ encMigrationAuth` as the `migrationAuth` can be guessed for all keys created with `CreateWrapKey`.",
