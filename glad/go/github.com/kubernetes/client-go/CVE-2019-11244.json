  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-11244",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/kubernetes/client-go",
  "Title": "Information Exposure Through Caching",
  "Description": "In Kubernetes, schema info is cached by `kubectl` in the location specified by `--cache-dir` (defaulting to `$HOME/.kube/http-cache`), written with world-writeable permissions (`rw-rw-rw-`). If `--cache-dir` is specified and pointed at a different location accessible to other users/groups, the written files may be modified by other users/groups and disrupt the kubectl invocation.",
