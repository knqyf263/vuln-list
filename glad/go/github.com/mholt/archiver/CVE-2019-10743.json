  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-10743",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/mholt/archiver",
  "Title": "Path Traversal",
  "Description": "All versions of archiver allow attacker to perform a Zip Slip attack via the `unarchive` functions. It is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip may hold a file with a `../../file.exe` location and thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.",
