  "Identifier": "CVE-2020-26160",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go",
  "Title": "Missing Authorization",
  "Description": "jwt-go allows attackers to bypass intended access restrictions in situations with `[]string{}` for `m[\"aud\"]` (which is allowed by the specification). Because the type assertion fails, \"\" is the value of `aud`. This is a security problem if the JWT token is presented to a service that lacks its own audience check.",
