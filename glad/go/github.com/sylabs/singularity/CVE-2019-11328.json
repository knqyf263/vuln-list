  "Identifier": "CVE-2019-11328",
  "PackageSlug": "go/github.com/sylabs/singularity",
  "Title": "Improper Access Control",
  "Description": "An issue was discovered in Singularity, a malicious user with local/network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability due to insecure permissions allowing a user to edit files within `/run/singularity/instances/sing/\u003cuser\u003e/\u003cinstance\u003e`. The manipulation of those files can change the behavior of the starter-suid program when instances are joined resulting in potential privilege escalation on the host.",
