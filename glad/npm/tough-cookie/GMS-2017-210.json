  "Title": "Regular Expression Denial of Service",
  "Description": "The `tough-cookie` module is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service. Input of around 50k characters is required for a slow down of around 2 seconds. Unless node was compiled using the `-DHTTP_MAX_HEADER_SIZE=` option the default header max length is kb so the impact of the ReDoS is limited to around 7.3 seconds of blocking.",
