  "Advisory": "Scalyr-agent-2 version 2.1.10 fixes two bugs which opened up the possibility for MITM attack if an attacker was able to spoof or control the DNS. Additionally, this version explicitly requests TLS v1.2, which makes the agent more robust against potential downgrade attacks when connecting to the Scalyr API. This is only true when running the agent under Python >= 2.7.9.",
