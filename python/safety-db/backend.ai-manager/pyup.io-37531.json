  "Advisory": "Backend.ai-manager 19.09.0rc4 fixes privilege escalation because domain-admins could run sessions on behalf of super-admins in the same domain. It also introduces Image import (171) - currently this is limited to import Python-based kernels only. This is implemented on top of batch tasks, with some specialization to prevent security issues due to direct access to agent host's Docker daemon.  Importing as service-port only image support will be added in future releases.",
