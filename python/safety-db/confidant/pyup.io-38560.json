  "Advisory": "Confidant 6.3.0 adds support for keeping track of when credentials should be rotated. It therefore adds three new fields to the Credential model, two of which improve the security (`last_decrypted_date` and `last_rotation_date`). The former explicitly stores when someone viewed a credential. Certain credentials can potentially be highly vulnerable and could benefit from being rotated the moment the credential pair is viewed. The latter stores when a credential was last rotated. Some credentials might need to periodically be rotated for security purposes.",
