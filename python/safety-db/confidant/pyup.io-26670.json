  "Advisory": "Confidant 1.1.13 includes a security fix. It was discovered when adding tests after a refactor of some of the KMS authentication code that confidant wasn't properly checking the expiration of KMS auth tokens. If tokens were able to be exfiltrated from a service, they could be used indefinitely. Also, any tokens that are expired will now correctly fail to authenticate.",
