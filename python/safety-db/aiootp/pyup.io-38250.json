  "Advisory": "Aiootp 0.2.0 adds ephemeral salts to the ``AsyncDatabase`` & ``Database`` file encryption procedures. This is a major security fix, as re-encryption of files with the same tag in a database with the same open key would use the same streams of key material each time, breaking encryption if two different versions of a tag file's ciphertext stored to disk were available to an adversary. The database methods ``encrypt``, ``decrypt``,  ``aencrypt`` & ``adecrypt`` will now produce and decipher true one-time pad ciphertext with these ephemeral salts.",
