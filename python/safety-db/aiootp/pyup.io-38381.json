  "Advisory": "Aiootp 0.8.0 fixes the test_hmac and atest_hmac functions in the keys & database classes. The new non-constant-time algorithm needs a random salt to be added before doing the secondary hmac to prevent some potential exotic forms of chosen plaintext/ciphertext attacks on the algorithm. The last version of the algorithm should not be used. \r\n\r\nAlso, the 'Keys' & 'AsyncKeys' interfaces were overhauled to remove the persistance of instance salts. They were intended to be updated by users with the 'reset' & 'areset' methods, but that cannot be guaranteed easily through the class, so it is an inappropriate interface since reusing salts for encryption is completely insecure. The instances do still maintain state of their main encryption key, & new stateful methods for key generation, like 'mnemonic' & 'table_key', have been added. The 'state' & 'astate' methods have been removed.",
