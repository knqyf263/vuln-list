  "Advisory": "Aiootp 0.9.1 includes two security improvements:\r\n\r\n- Any falsey values for the 'salt' keyword argument in the library's 'keys', 'akeys', 'bytes_keys', 'abytes_keys', 'subkeys', & 'asubkeys' infinite keystream generators, & other functions around the library, will cause them to generate a new cryptographically secure pseudo-random value for the salt. It formerly only did this when 'salt' was 'None'. \r\n\r\n- The 'seeder' & 'aseeder' generators have been updated to introduce 512 new bits of entropy from 'secrets.token_bytes' on every iteration to ensure that the CSPRNG will produce secure outputs even if its internal state is somehow discovered. This also allows for simply calling the CSPRNG is enough, there's no longer a strong reason to pass new entropy into it manually, except to add even more entropy as desired.",
