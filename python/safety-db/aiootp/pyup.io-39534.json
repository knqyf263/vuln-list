  "Advisory": "Aiootp 0.17.0 includes a security patch for a critical vulnerability (highly recommended to upgrade). The HMAC verifiers on ciphertexts did not include the 'salt' or 'pid' values when deriving the HMAC. This associated data can therefore be changed to cause a party to decrypt a past ciphertext with a salt or pid of an attacker's choosing.",
