  "Advisory": "Aiootp 0.9.2 adds 'passcrypt' & 'apasscrypt' instance methods to 'OneTimePad', 'Keys', & 'AsyncKeys' classes. They produce password hashes that are not just secured by the salt & passcrypt algorithm settings, but also by their main symmetric instance keys. This makes passwords infeasible to crack without also compromising the instance's 512-bit key.\r\n\r\nAlso, Aiootp 0.9.2 includes further improvements to the random number generator in 'randoms.py'.   This made its internals less sequential and thereby raises the bar of work needed by an attacker to successfully carry out an order prediction attack.",
