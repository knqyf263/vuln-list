  "Advisory": "The `Opake.client` & `Opake.client_registration` methods in aiootp version 0.11.0 take an instantiated client database instead of client credentials which  improves security, efficiency & usability. This change reduces the amount of exposure received by user passwords & other credentials. It also  simplifies usage of the protocol by only needing to carry around a  database instead of a slew of credentials, which is also faster, since the credentials are passed through the cpu & memory hard `passcrypt` function every time to open the database.",
