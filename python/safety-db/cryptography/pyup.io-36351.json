  "Advisory": "python-cryptography versions >=1.9.0 and <2.3 did not enforce a minimum tag length for finalize_with_tag API. If a user did not validate the input length prior to passing it to finalize_with_tag an attacker could craft an invalid payload with a shortened tag (e.g. 1 byte) such that they would have a 1 in 256 chance of passing the MAC check. GCM tag forgeries can cause key leakage.",
