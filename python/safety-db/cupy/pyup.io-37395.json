  "Advisory": "`cupy.load` in cupy 7.0.0b2 specifies `allow_pickle=False` by default to follow the security fix made in NumPy 1.16.3 (see https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/13359 and https://github.com/cupy/cupy/pull/2290). Most users should not be affected by this change; users loading `ndarray` serialized using pickle may need to explicitly specify `allow_pickle=True`.",
