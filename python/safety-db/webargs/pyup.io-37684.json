  "Advisory": "Flaskparser.py in Webargs 6.0.0b1 through 6.0.0b4 doesn't check that the Content-Type header is application/json when receiving JSON input. If the request body is valid JSON, it will accept it even if the content type is application/x-www-form-urlencoded. This allows for JSON POST requests to be made across domains, leading to CSRF.
