  "Advisory": "Restrictedpython 4.0 ships with a default implementation for ``_getattr_`` which prevents from using the ``format()`` method on str/unicode as it is not safe. See <http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/>.\r\n\r\n **Caution:** If you do not already have secured the access to this ``format()`` method in your ``_getattr_`` implementation use ``RestrictedPython.Guards.safer_getattr()`` in your implementation to benefit from this fix.",
