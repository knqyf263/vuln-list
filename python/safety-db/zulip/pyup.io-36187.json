  "Advisory": "Zulip 1.8.0 includes several important security fixes since 1.7.0, which were released already in 1.7.1 and 1.7.2.\r\n- The security model for private streams has changed.  Now organization administrators can remove users, edit descriptions, and rename private streams they are not subscribed to.  See Zulip's security model documentation for details.\r\n- On Xenial, the local uploads backend now does the same security checks that the S3 backend did before serving files to users. Ubuntu Trusty's version of nginx is too old to support this and so the legacy model is the default; we recommend upgrading.",
