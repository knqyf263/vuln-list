  "Advisory": "Benchexec 2.2 fixes two security issues:\r\n- Since BenchExec 2.1, the setup of the container for the tool-info module (which was added in BenchExec 1.20) could silently fail, for example if user namespaces are disabled on the system. In this case the tool-info module would be executed outside of the container. Run execution was not affected.\r\n- The kernel offers a keyring feature for storage of keys related to features like Kerberos and ecryptfs. Before Linux 5.2, there existed one keyring per user, and BenchExec did not prevent access from the tool inside the container to the kernel keyring of the user who started BenchExec. Now such accesses are forbidden (on all kernel versions) using seccomp (http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/seccomp.2.html) if libseccomp2 (https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp) is installed, which should be the case on any standard distribution. Note that seccomp filters do have a slight performance impact and could prevent some binaries on exotic architectures from working. In such a case please file a bug report (https://github.com/sosy-lab/benchexec/issues/new).",
