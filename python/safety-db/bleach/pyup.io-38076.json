  "Advisory": "The ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing embedded MathML and SVG content with RCDATA tags in Bleach versions <= 3.1.1 did not match browser behavior and could result in a mutation XSS.\r\n\r\nCalls to ``bleach.clean`` with ``strip=False`` and ``math`` or ``svg`` tags and one or more of the RCDATA tags ``script``, ``noscript``, ``style``, ``noframes``, ``iframe``, ``noembed``, or ``xmp`` in the allowed tags whitelist were vulnerable to a mutation XSS.\r\n\r\nThis security issue was confirmed in Bleach version v3.1.1. Earlier versions are likely affected too.",
