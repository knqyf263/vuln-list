  "Advisory": "The ``bleach.clean`` behavior parsing style attributes in bleach before 3.1.4 could result in a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). Calls to ``bleach.clean`` with an allowed tag with an allowed ``style`` attribute were vulnerable to ReDoS. For example, ``bleach.clean(..., attributes={'a': ['style']})``.  This issue was confirmed in Bleach versions v3.1.3, v3.1.2, v3.1.1, v3.1.0, v3.0.0, v2.1.4, and v2.1.3. Earlier versions used a similar regular expression and should be considered vulnerable too.",
