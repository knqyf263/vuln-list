  "Advisory": "In supervisor before 3.3.3 (fix backported to 3.2.4, 3.1.4 and 3.0.1) a vulnerability was found where an authenticated client can send a malicious XML-RPC request to ``supervisord`` that will run arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as ``supervisord``.  Depending on how ``supervisord`` has been configured, this may be root.  See https://github.com/Supervisor/supervisor/issues/964 for details.",
