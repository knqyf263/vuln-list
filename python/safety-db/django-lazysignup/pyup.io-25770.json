  "Advisory": "django-lazysignup before 0.4.0 fixes a security issue: Generated usernames are now based on the session key, rather than actually being the session key. This is to avoid a potential security issue where an app might simply display a username, giving away a significant part of the user's session key. The username is now generated from a SHA1 hash of the session key. This change means that existing generated users will become invalid.",
