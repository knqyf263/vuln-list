  "Advisory": "maxminddb 1.1.2 includes a number of important security fixes. Among these fixes is improved validation of the database metadata. Unfortunately,  MaxMind GeoIP2 and GeoLite2 databases created earlier than January 28, 2014  had an invalid data type for the `record_size` in the metadata. Previously these databases worked on little endian machines with libmaxminddb but did not work on big endian machines. Due to increased safety checks when reading the file, these databases will no longer work on any platform. If you are using one of these databases, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest GeoLite2 or GeoIP2 database",
