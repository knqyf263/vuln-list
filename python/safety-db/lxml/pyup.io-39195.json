  "Advisory": "In lxml before 4.4.0, when writing to file paths that contain the URL escape character '%', the file path could wrongly be mangled by URL unescaping and thus write to a different file or directory.  Code that writes to file paths that are provided by untrusted sources, but that must work with previous versions of lxml, should best either reject paths that contain '%' characters, or otherwise make sure that the path does not contain maliciously injected '%XX' URL hex escapes for paths like '../'.",
