  "Advisory": "Sncli 0.4.0 contains a security fix for an arbitrary code execution bug. Copying text from notes to the clipboard was being performed by building a shell command to execute. This resulted in the line being copied substituted directly into the shell command. A carefully crafted line could run any arbitrary shell command, and some lines could crash the\r\nprocess causing the line to fail to copy. This fixes the issue by not using a shell to interpret the command, and\r\npassing the text to be copied directly to stdin.",
