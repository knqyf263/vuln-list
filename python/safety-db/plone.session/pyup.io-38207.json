  "Advisory": "Plone.session 3.6.2 hardens the default timeout of session. This solves Plone security internal issue 126 (severity low, non-critical). Also, the session timeout is now the same as in mod_auth_tkt: 2h. This follows the recommendation of the German BSI (federal office for security in the information technology) - see <https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Internetsicherheit/isi_web_server_checkliste_Plone.pdf>.  For existing sites this can be adjusted at <https://HOST/acl_users/session/manage_propertiesForm>. The Plone Security Team follows the BSI and recommends administrators to change the setting in their existing Plone sites.",
