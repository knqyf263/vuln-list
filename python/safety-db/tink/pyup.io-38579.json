An attacker can generate ciphertexts that bypass the HMAC verification if and only if all of the following conditions are true:\r\n\r\n* Tink C++ is used on systems where size_t is a 32-bit integer. This is usually the case on 32-bit machines.\r\n* The attacker can specify long (>= 2^29 bytes ~ 536MB) associated data.",
