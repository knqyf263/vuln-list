  "Advisory": "Versions of getmail prior to 4.2.0 and 3.2.5 contain a security vulnerability. A local attacker with a shell account could exploit a race condition (or a similar symlink attack) to cause getmail to create or overwrite files in a directory of the local user's choosing if the system administrator ran getmail as root and delivered messages to a maildir or mbox file under the control of the attacker, resulting in a local root exploit. (This vulnerability is not exploitable if the administrator does not deliver mail to the maildirs/mbox files of untrusted local users, or if getmail is configured to use an external unprivileged MDA. Also, this vulnerability is not remotely exploitable.)",
