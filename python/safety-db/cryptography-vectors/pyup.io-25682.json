  "Advisory": "The OpenSSL backend prior to 1.0.2 made extensive use  of assertions to check response codes where our tests could not trigger a  failure.  However, when Python is run with ``-O`` these asserts are optimized  away.  If a user ran Python with this flag and got an invalid response code  this could result in undefined behavior or worse. Accordingly, all response  checks from the OpenSSL backend have been converted from ``assert``  to a true function call. Credit **Emilia KÃ¤sper (Google Security Team)**  for the report.",
