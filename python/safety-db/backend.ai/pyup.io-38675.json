  "Advisory": "Backend.ai 19.09.0rc4 includes image import. This is implemented on top of batch tasks, with some specialization to prevent security issues due to direct access to agent host's Docker daemon.  Importing as service-port only image support will be added in future releases. Additionally, it includes a privilege escalation fix because domain-admins could run sessions on behalf of super-admins in the same domain.",
