  "Advisory": "CVE-2020-13254: Potential data leakage via malformed memcached keys. In cases where a memcached backend does not perform key validation, passing malformed cache keys could result in a key collision, and potential data leakage. In order to avoid this vulnerability, key validation is added to the memcached cache backends.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Django 2.2.13 and 3.0.7 upgrade the version of jQuery used by the admin to 3.5.1 for security reasons.",
