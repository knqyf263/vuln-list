In older versions, if a password isn't manually specified in the database\r\nsettings ``TEST`` dictionary, a hardcoded password is used. This could allow\r\nan attacker with network access to the database server to connect.\r\n\r\nThis user is usually dropped after the test suite completes, but not when using\r\nthe ``manage.py test --keepdb`` option or if the user has an active session\r\n(such as an attacker's connection).\r\n\r\nA randomly generated password is now used for each test run.\r\n\r\nDNS rebinding vulnerability when ``DEBUG=True``\r\n===============================================",
