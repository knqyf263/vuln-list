  "Advisory": "Django 1.10.8 fixes a security issue in 1.10.7.  In older versions, HTML autoescaping was disabled in a portion of the template for the technical 500 debug page. Given the right circumstances, this allowed a cross-site scripting attack. This vulnerability shouldn't affect most production sites since you shouldn't run with 'DEBUG = True' (which makes this page accessible) in your production settings. See also: CVE-2017-12794, described as \"Possible XSS in traceback section of technical 500 debug page\".",
