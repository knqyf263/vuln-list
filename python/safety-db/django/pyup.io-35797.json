  "Advisory": "The ``django.utils.html.urlize()`` function was extremely slow to evaluate\r\ncertain inputs due to a catastrophic backtracking vulnerability in a regular\r\nexpression. The ``urlize()`` function is used to implement the ``urlize`` and\r\n``urlizetrunc`` template filters, which were thus vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe problematic regular expression is replaced with parsing logic that behaves\r\nsimilarly.",
