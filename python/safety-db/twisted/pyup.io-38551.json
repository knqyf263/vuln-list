  "Advisory": "Twisted Web 16.4.0 includes the following three security fixes:\r\n- A bug in twisted.web.server.Site.makeSession which may lead to predictable session IDs was fixed.  Session IDs are now generated securely using `os.urandom`.\r\n- twisted.web.server.Request.getSession will now, for a request sent over HTTPS, set a \"Secure\" cookie, preventing the secure session from being sent over plain-text HTTP. \r\n- twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript will now not pass the \"Proxy\" header to CGI scripts, as a mitigation to CVE-2016-1000111.",
