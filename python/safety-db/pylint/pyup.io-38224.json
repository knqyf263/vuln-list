  "Advisory": "Pylint 2.5.0 no longer allows ``python -m pylint ...`` to import user code. Previously, it added the current working directory as the first element of ``sys.path``. This opened up a potential security hole where ``pylint`` would import user level code as long as that code resided in modules having the same name as stdlib or pylint's own modules.",
