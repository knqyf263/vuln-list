  "Advisory": "To address security vulnerabilities, pywbem 1.0.0b1 increases the versions of requests (from 2.19.1 to 2.20.1), urllib3 (from 1.22 to 1.23), and bleach (from 2.1.0 to 2.1.4). These packages are only used for development of pywbem.\r\n\r\nAlso, pywbem 1.0.0b1 changes the HTTPS support of `pywbem.WBEMListener` from using the deprecated `ssl.wrap_socket()` function to using the `ssl.SSLContext` class that was introduced in Python 2.7.9. This causes more secure SSL settings to be used. On Python versions before 2.7.9, pywbem will continue to use the deprecated `ssl.wrap_socket()` function.",
