  "Advisory": "Setting `verify_ssl` to `False` in the client configuration of launchdarkly-server-sdk before 6.12.2 did not have the expected effect of completely turning off SSL/TLS verification, because it still left _certificate_ verification in effect, so it would allow a totally insecure connection but reject a secure connection whose certificate had an unknown CA. This has been changed so that it will turn off certificate verification as well. This is not a recommended practice and a future version of the SDK will add a way to specify a custom certificate authority instead (to support, for instance, using the Relay Proxy with a self-signed certificate).",
