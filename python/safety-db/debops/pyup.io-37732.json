  "Advisory": "Debops 1.7.0 includes a change in its RoundCube configuration. RoundCube will use the user login and password credentials to authenticate to the SMTP (submission) service before sending e-mail messages. This allows the SMTP server to check the message details, block mail with forged sender address, etc. The default configuration uses encrypted connections to the IMAP and SMTP services to ensure confidentiality and security.",
