  "Advisory": "The :command:`lxc-prepare-ssh` script in debops 1.1.0 will no longer install SSH keys from the LXC host ``root`` account on the LXC container ``root`` account. This can cause confusion and unintended security breaches when other services (for example backup scripts or remote command execution tools) install their own SSH keys on the LXC host and they are subsequently copied inside of the LXC containers created on that host.",
