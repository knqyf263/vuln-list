  "Advisory": "Debops 1.0.0:\r\n\r\n- The :command:`lxc-prepare-ssh` script will read the public SSH keys from specific files (``root`` key file, and the ``$SUDO_USER`` key file) and will not accept any custom files to read from, to avoid possible security issues. Each public SSH key listed in the key files is validated before being added to the container's ``root`` account.\r\n\r\n- The :command:`lxc-new-unprivileged` script will similarly not accept any custom files as initial LXC container configuration to fix any potential security holes when used via :command:`sudo`. The default LXC configuration file used by the script can be configured in :file:`/etc/lxc/lxc.conf` configuration file.\r\n\r\n- (:ref:`debops.php` role) New APT signing keys` have been created for his Debian APT repository with PHP packages, due to security concerns. The :ref:`debops.php` role will remove the old APT GPG key and add the new one automatically. See: <https://www.patreon.com/posts/dpa-new-signing-25451165>.",
