  "Advisory": "Tiny-gnupg 0.3.0 overhauls the ``gen_key()`` which now creates a different set of default keys. It no longer creates one primary key which does certifying & signing, with one subkey which handles encryption. Instead, tiny-gnupg 0.3.0 creates one certifying primary key, with three subkeys, one each for handling encryption, authentication, & signing. This is a more theoretically secure default key setup, & represents a common best-practice.",
