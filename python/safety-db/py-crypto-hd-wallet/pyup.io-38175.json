  "Advisory": "Py-crypto-hd-wallet 0.2.0 removes the possibility to load a wallet from file. This did not make a lot of sense because saving a wallet to file in JSON format is only meant for a quick and temporary storing of keys, not as a definitive and secure way to store it. For storing a wallet for future loading, it'd make more sense to just store the mnemonic, seed or extended key (depending how the wallet was generated) instead of the complete key chain by adding some security (e.g. crypting the file). This can be done by the user directly, in the way he prefers, with the APIs that are present now.",
