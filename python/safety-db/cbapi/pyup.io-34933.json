This does *not* affect code that uses CbAPI through the public interfaces documented here; it only affects code that accesses the new  ``CbAPISessionAdapter`` class directly. This class was introduced in version 1.3.3. Regardless, it is strongly recommended that all users currently using 1.3.3 upgrade to 1.3.4.",
