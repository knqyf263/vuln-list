  "Advisory": "Qutebrowser 1.11.1 includes a fix for CVE-2020-11054:  After a certificate error was overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow (`colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg`). However, when the affected website was subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green (`colors.statusbar.url.success_https`). While the user already has seen a certificate error prompt at this point (or set `content.ssl_strict` to `false` which is not recommended), this could still provide a false sense of security. This is now fixed.",
