  "Advisory": "Users who are using urllib3 version 1.17 or 1.18 along with PyOpenSSL injection and OpenSSL 1.1.0 *must* upgrade to this version. This release fixes a vulnerability whereby urllib3 in the above configuration would silently fail to validate TLS certificates due to erroneously setting invalid flags in OpenSSL's ``SSL_CTX_set_verify`` function. These erroneous flags do not cause a problem in OpenSSL versions before 1.1.0, which interprets the presence of any flag as requesting certificate validation.",
