  "Advisory": "In django-storages before 1.7 - the ``S3BotoStorage`` and ``S3Boto3Storage`` backends have an insecure default ACL of ``public-read``. It is recommended that all current users upgrade to 1.7 and audit their bucket permissions.  Support has been added for setting ``AWS_DEFAULT_ACL = None`` and ``AWS_BUCKET_ACL = None``. V1.7 will raise a warning if ``AWS_DEFAULT_ACL`` or ``AWS_BUCKET_ACL`` is not explicitly set.",
