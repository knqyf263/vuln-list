  "Advisory": "In django-cors-headers version 3.0.0, ``CORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST`` requires URI schemes, and optionally ports. This is part of the CORS specification (Section 3.2 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6454section-3.2>) that was not implemented in this library, except from with the ``CORS_ORIGIN_REGEX_WHITELIST`` setting. It fixes a security issue where the CORS middleware would allow requests between schemes, for example from insecure ``http://`` Origins to a secure ``https://`` site.\r\n\r\nYou will need to update your whitelist to include schemes, for example from this:\r\n\r\nCORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = ['example.com']\r\n\r\nto this:\r\n\r\nCORS_ORIGIN_WHITELIST = ['https://example.com']",
