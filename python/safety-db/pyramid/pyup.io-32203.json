  "Advisory": "Pyramid 1.6a1 improves robustness to timing attacks in the ``AuthTktCookieHelper`` and the ``SignedCookieSessionFactory`` classes by using the stdlib's ``hmac.compare_digest`` if it is available (such as Python 2.7.7+ and 3.3+). See: <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1457>. Also, it avoids timing attacks against CSRF tokens. See: <https://github.com/Pylons/pyramid/pull/1574>.",
