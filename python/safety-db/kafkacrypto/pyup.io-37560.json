  "Advisory": "Kafkacrypto 0.9.8 includes:\r\n-  Implementation of allowlist and denylists. This removes the need for separate code pathways for root of trusts, enabling them to be treated as entries in allowlist.\r\n- Implementation of automatic processing of messages to adjust allowlists, denylists, and chains. This enables very short chain lifetimes, a security benefit. It also enables a private key to self-sign that it should be revoked.\r\n- Implementation of a pathlength constraint for further tightening of chains. Minimum usable value is typically 1, unless the end of the chain will not sign any further messages.\r\n- Fix kafka wrapper poll implementation to make the timeout optional.",
