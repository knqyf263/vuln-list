  "Advisory": "Authentication tokens in baseplate 0.22.0 provided by the authentication service can now be automatically propagated between services when making Thrift calls. This allows internal services to securely and accurately understand on whose behalf a given request is being made so they can decide if the requester is authorized for a particular action. The context is passed implicitly, in request headers, so no extra parameters need be added to service IDLs. Baseplate provides APIs for validating and accessing the tokens from within request context and will automatically pass upstream credentials to downstream services without extra work.",
