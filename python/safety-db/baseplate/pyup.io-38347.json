  "Advisory": "Baseplate 0.24.0 includes a EdgeRequestContext/AuthenticationToken unification. This isn't a new addition, but a **breaking** rework of authentication context in Baseplate. Authentication token propagation and access is now fully integrated into the edge request context. Authentication tokens are propagated inside the edge context header and the API for applications built on Baseplate is unified. See below for details on how to use this.",
