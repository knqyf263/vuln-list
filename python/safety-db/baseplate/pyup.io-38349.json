  "Advisory": "Baseplate 0.19.0 includes support for fetching secrets in a secure, auditable, manner from Hashicorp Vault. A sidecar daemon manages the infrastructure-level authentication with Vault and fetches secrets to a file on disk. Helpers in Baseplate then allow your application to fetch these secrets efficiently from the sidecar daemon with some helpful conventions for versioning/key rotation. This is now the right way to get secret tokens into your application going forward. See: <http://baseplate.readthedocs.io/en/v0.19.0/baseplate/secrets.html>.",
