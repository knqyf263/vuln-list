  "Advisory": "Communication between the sync daemon and frontend (GUI or CLI) in maestral 0.4.1 is faster and more secure than in previous versions. Additionally, it uses Unix domain sockets instead of TCP/IP sockets for communication with daemon. This means that communication is lighter, faster and more secure (other users on the same PC  can no longer connect to your sync daemon).",
